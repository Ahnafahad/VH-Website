## Question 1 – Reversing Entry

**Question**

A credit balance brought down on a rent expense account means:

- A. We owe that rent at that date  
- B. We have paid that rent in advance at that date  
- C. We have paid too much rent  
- D. We have paid too little in rent  

**Correct Answer:** A  

**Explanation**

In the **rent expense** account, rent **paid** is recorded on the **debit** side.  
If at the end of a period some rent is still **owing (accrued)**, the adjusting entry is:

> Rent Expense       Dr  
>        Rent Payable        Cr

This credit makes the rent expense account show a **credit balance** equal to the unpaid amount.  
When that balance is brought down to the next period, it represents **rent payable**—that is, **we owe that rent at that date**.

## Question 2 – Operating Expenses in a Merchandising Business

**Question**

A company had Tk. 7,00,000 in sales, with selling expenses at 40% of sales and administrative expenses at 25% of sales.  
What is the amount of Operating expenses?

- A. Tk. 2,12,000  
- B. Tk. 1,17,000  
- C. Tk. 3,07,000  
- D. Tk. 4,29,000  

**Correct Answer:** _None of the options (question as printed is inconsistent)_  

**Correct Calculation**

Operating expenses = Selling expenses + Administrative expenses  

Given that **both** are stated as a **percentage of sales**:

- Selling expenses = 40% × 7,00,000  
  = 0.40 × 7,00,000  
  = Tk. 2,80,000  

- Administrative expenses = 25% × 7,00,000  
  = 0.25 × 7,00,000  
  = Tk. 1,75,000  

Total operating expenses = 2,80,000 + 1,75,000  
= Tk. **4,55,000**

Since **Tk. 4,55,000** does **not** appear in the options, the original options/answer key are likely misprinted.  
Use Tk. **4,55,000** as the correct operating-expense amount for practice.

## Question 3 – Cost of Goods Sold with a Given Gross Profit Rate

**Question**

K Company began 2005 with merchandise inventory of Tk. 1,25,000.  
During 2005, purchases were Tk. 50,000, freight‑in Tk. 2,000, purchase returns Tk. 5,000, and sales were Tk. 2,00,000.  
Administrative expenses were Tk. 50,000.  
Ending inventory of 2006 was Tk. 80,000, and opening inventory of 2006 was Tk. 60,000.  
Given a gross profit rate of 30%, what is the **cost of goods sold** (COGS) for 2005?

- A. Tk. 1,40,000 (Tk. 7,00,000)  
- B. Tk. 2,90,000 (Tk. 6,30,000)  
- C. Tk. 3,20,000 (Tk. 2,55,000)  
- D. Tk. 8,75,000 (Tk. 8,75,000)  

**Correct Answer:** A – Tk. 1,40,000  

> The extra numbers in brackets in the options and the 2006 inventory figures are not needed
> for answering this question and may come from the original exam formatting.

**Step 1 – Use the gross profit rate**

Gross profit rate = 30% of **sales**  

Sales = Tk. 2,00,000  

Cost of goods sold = Sales × (1 − Gross profit rate)  
= 2,00,000 × (1 − 0.30)  
= 2,00,000 × 0.70  
= Tk. **1,40,000**

So the **cost of goods sold** is Tk. **1,40,000**, which matches **option A**.

**Step 2 – (Optional cross‑check using inventory & purchases)**  

Goods available for sale for 2005:

- Beginning inventory (2005) = Tk. 1,25,000  
- Purchases = Tk. 50,000  
- Less: Purchase returns = (Tk. 5,000)  
- Add: Freight‑in = Tk. 2,000  

Net purchases = 50,000 − 5,000 + 2,000 = Tk. 47,000  

Goods available for sale = 1,25,000 + 47,000 = Tk. 1,72,000  

If COGS = 1,40,000, then implied ending inventory for 2005 would be:

Ending inventory (2005) = 1,72,000 − 1,40,000 = Tk. 32,000  

This differs from the Tk. 60,000 stated as opening inventory of 2006, which suggests
the original question combines data from more than one year or contains a typo.  
For purposes of the MCQ, **focus on the gross‑profit‑rate method**, which gives  
COGS = Tk. **1,40,000**.
