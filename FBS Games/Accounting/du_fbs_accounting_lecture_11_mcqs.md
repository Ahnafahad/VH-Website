## Part A – Income Tax & VAT Basics

### Question 1

**Question**

If the net profit of a firm is Tk. 6,000 and tax rate is 40%, then the amount of profit **before tax** will be:

**Options**

- A. Tk. 9,000  
- B. Tk. 7,942  
- C. Tk. 3,000  
- D. Tk. 8,333  
- E. Tk. 10,000  

**Correct Answer:** **E. Tk. 10,000**

**Explanation**

Net profit after tax = Tk. 6,000  
Tax rate = 40%

Net profit represents **60%** of profit before tax (100% − 40%).

So,

\[
0.60 \times \text{Profit before tax} = 6,000
\]

\[
\text{Profit before tax} = \frac{6,000}{0.60} = 10,000
\]

Check:

- Tax = 10,000 × 40% = 4,000  
- Net profit = 10,000 − 4,000 = 6,000 ✓

### Question 2

**Question**

What type of item is the VAT on sales?

**Options**

- A. Expense  
- B. Asset  
- C. Capital  
- D. Revenue  
- E. Liability  

**Correct Answer:** **E. Liability**

**Explanation**

VAT collected on sales is **not income** of the business. The firm collects it on behalf of the government and must later pay it to the tax authority.

Therefore, VAT on sales is recorded as a **liability (VAT Payable)** until it is remitted.

### Question 3

**Question**

After deducting commission of partner Y at the rate of 5% on net profit **after commission**, Y received Tk. 1,000 as his commission. He is an equal partner with X and Z. How much will Y get as his **share of profit** (excluding commission) from the partnership?

**Options**

- A. 6,667  
- B. 7,000  
- C. 7,333  
- D. 7,667  
- E. 6,333  

**Correct Answer:** **A. 6,667**

**Explanation**

Let **P** = profit **before** Y’s commission.

Y’s commission = 5% of (P − commission)

Given commission = 1,000:

\[
1,000 = 0.05 (P - 1,000)
\]

\[
1,000 = 0.05P - 50 \Rightarrow 1,050 = 0.05P \Rightarrow P = 21,000
\]

Divisible profit **after** commission:

\[
P - \text{commission} = 21,000 - 1,000 = 20,000
\]

Partners X, Y, Z share profits equally:

\[
\text{Y’s share of profit} = \frac{20,000}{3} \approx 6,666.67 \approx \mathbf{6,667}
\]

(Commission of Tk. 1,000 is **extra** and not part of this 6,667.)

### Question 4

**Question**

If the net income of a firm is Tk. 5,000 and the tax rate is 40%, then the amount of profit **before tax** is:

**Options**

- A. Tk. 9,000  
- B. Tk. 7,942  
- C. Tk. 8,333  
- D. Tk. 10,000  
- E. Tk. 8,700  

**Correct Answer:** **C. Tk. 8,333**

**Explanation**

Net income after tax = Tk. 5,000  
Tax rate = 40%

Net income represents **60%** of profit before tax.

\[
0.60 \times \text{Profit before tax} = 5,000
\]

\[
\text{Profit before tax} = \frac{5,000}{0.60} \approx 8,333.33 \approx \mathbf{8,333}
\]

Check:

- Tax ≈ 8,333 × 40% ≈ 3,333  
- Net income ≈ 8,333 − 3,333 ≈ 5,000 ✓

## Part B – Correcting Entries

### Question 5

**Question**

Credit sales of Tk. 600 were credited to the Sales Account **and** to the Debtors Account. What is its effect?

**Options**

- A. Debtors account will be reduced by Tk. 1,200  
- B. Creditors account will be reduced by Tk. 600  
- C. Profit will be reduced by Tk. 1,200  
- D. Profit will be overstated by Tk. 600  
- E. Sales account and Debtors account will be affected equally  

**Correct Answer:** **A. Debtors account will be reduced by Tk. 1,200**

**Explanation**

Correct entry for a credit sale of Tk. 600 is:

- **Dr Debtors 600**  
- **Cr Sales 600**

What was actually done:

- Cr Sales 600  ✅ (correct)  
- Cr Debtors 600  ❌ (should have been debit)

Effect on Debtors:

- Should be **Dr 600** but is **Cr 600**  
- Difference from correct position = 600 (missing debit) + 600 (wrong credit) = **1,200**

So the Debtors balance is **understated by Tk. 1,200** (i.e., “reduced by Tk. 1,200” compared with the correct balance).

Rectification (not asked, but useful):

- Dr Debtors 1,200  
- Cr Suspense 1,200

### Question 6

**Question**

An amount of Tk. 12,800 paid for salary was recorded in the books as Tk. 18,200. The correcting entry would be:

**Options**

- A. Salary Dr. 18,200; Cash Cr. 18,200  
- B. Cash Dr. 12,800; Salary Cr. 12,800  
- C. Salary Dr. 5,400; Cash Cr. 5,400  
- D. Cash Dr. 5,400; Salary Cr. 5,400  
- E. Cash Dr. 5,400; Bank Cr. 5,400  

**Correct Answer:** **D. Cash Dr. 5,400; Salary Cr. 5,400**

**Explanation**

Correct entry (what should have been recorded):

- Salary Dr 12,800  
- Cash Cr 12,800  

Wrong entry recorded:

- Salary Dr 18,200  
- Cash Cr 18,200  

Both Salary and Cash are **overstated** by:

\[
18,200 - 12,800 = 5,400
\]

To remove the excess:

- **Dr Cash 5,400** → decreases the over‑credited Cash  
- **Cr Salary 5,400** → decreases the over‑debited Salary

So the correcting entry is:

> Cash A/C Dr 5,400  
> Salary A/C Cr 5,400

### Question 7

**Question**

A sales return has wrongly been recorded in the Purchases Day Book. What is the correct rectification entry?

**Options**

- A. Sales Return Debit; Purchases Credit  
- B. Purchases Debit; Sales Returns Credit  
- C. Suspense Account Debit; Purchases Credit  
- D. Suspense Account Debit; Sales Returns Credit  
- E. Purchases Debit; Suspense Account Credit  

**Correct Answer:** **A. Sales Return Debit; Purchases Credit**

**Explanation**

Correct treatment of a sales return:

- **Dr Sales Returns**  
- **Cr Debtor (customer)**

Wrong treatment (Purchases Day Book used):

- **Dr Purchases**  
- **Cr Debtor**

To rectify, we:

1. Cancel the wrong debit to Purchases by **crediting Purchases**.  
2. Record the correct debit to Sales Returns by **debiting Sales Returns**.

So the rectifying entry is:

> Sales Returns A/C Dr  
> To Purchases A/C

### Question 8

**Question**

Tk. 100 received from Karim was **debited** to Karim’s account. The journal entry to rectify this error is:

**Options**

- A. Suspense A/C Dr. Tk. 200; Karim A/C Cr. Tk. 200  
- B. Karim A/C Dr. Tk. 100; Suspense A/C Cr. Tk. 100  
- C. Suspense A/C Dr. Tk. 100; Karim A/C Cr. Tk. 100  
- D. Karim A/C Dr. Tk. 200; Suspense A/C Cr. Tk. 200  

**Correct Answer:** **A. Suspense A/C Dr. Tk. 200; Karim A/C Cr. Tk. 200**

**Explanation**

Correct entry for cash received from a debtor (Karim):

- **Dr Cash 100**  
- **Cr Karim 100**

Wrong entry passed:

- **Dr Karim 100**  
- (Likely Cr Cash 100 – but Karim’s side is definitely wrong)

So, in Karim’s account:

- Should have been **Cr 100**  
- Actually **Dr 100**  

Total adjustment required = 100 (to cancel wrong debit) + 100 (to create correct credit) = **Tk. 200** credit.

Rectification (using Suspense for the other side):

> Suspense A/C Dr 200  
> To Karim A/C Cr 200

This removes the incorrect debit of 100 and records the correct credit of 100, resulting in a net 200‑credit swing in Karim’s account.
