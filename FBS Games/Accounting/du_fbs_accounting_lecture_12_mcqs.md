# DU FBS Accounting – Lecture 12 MCQs

Topics covered in this lecture:

- **Capital & Revenue Income–Expenditure**
- **Single Entry System (Incomplete Records)**
- **Cash Flow Statement**
- **Introduction to Managerial Accounting**

The following questions are DU‑FBS style MCQs with checked answers and refined explanations. Some answers from the original slides were corrected where they conflicted with standard accounting principles.

## Part A – Capital & Revenue Income–Expenditure

### Question 1

**Question**

Which of the following is an example of deferred revenue expenditure?

**Options**

- A. Prepaid rent  
- B. Depreciation  
- C. Preliminary expenses  
- D. Discount on debenture  
- E. All of the above  

**Correct Answer:** **C. Preliminary expenses**

**Explanation**

**Deferred revenue expenditure** is a (large) revenue-type expense whose benefit is expected to last for **several future periods**, so it is written off gradually.

Classical textbook examples include:

- **Preliminary (formation) expenses**,  
- **Discount on issue of debentures/shares**,  
- Heavy advertising campaigns, etc.

Prepaid rent (A) is a **prepaid expense (current asset)** covering only the next period or so, not a multi‑year heavy outlay. Depreciation (B) is an **allocation of asset cost**, not an expenditure itself. Among the options, the most standard example of deferred revenue expenditure is **preliminary expenses**.

*(Note: Discount on debentures (D) is also often treated as a deferred revenue expenditure, but DU‑style MCQs usually expect “Preliminary expenses” here.)*

### Question 2

**Question**

Where will you report the capital expenditure?

**Options**

- A. Trading Account  
- B. Profit and Loss Account  
- C. Liability side of Balance Sheet  
- D. Asset side of Balance Sheet  
- E. Both A and B above  

**Correct Answer:** **D. Asset side of Balance Sheet**

**Explanation**

Capital expenditure is spent to **acquire or improve long‑term assets** (land, building, machinery, etc.). Such costs are **capitalized** as assets in the Balance Sheet and then depreciated over time. Only the depreciation charge appears in the Profit & Loss Account.

Therefore, capital expenditure itself is shown on the **asset side of the Balance Sheet**.

---

### Question 3

**Question**

Which of the following is **not** a deferred revenue expenditure?

**Options**

- A. Special type of repairing cost  
- B. Expenditure on shifting of a factory  
- C. Interest on loan  
- D. Expenditure on formation of a company  
- E. Advertisement expenditure of a large amount  

**Correct Answer:** **C. Interest on loan**

**Explanation**

Items such as **major repairs**, **factory shifting cost**, **company formation cost** and **heavy advertisement** all give benefit over several years and can be treated as **deferred revenue expenditure**.

- Interest on loan (C) is a **regular revenue expense** relating only to the current period and must be charged fully to the Profit & Loss Account in that year, so it is **not** deferred revenue expenditure.

---

### Question 4

**Question**

Addition to the plant assets is:

**Options**

- A. Revenue expenditure  
- B. Debited to a repair expense  
- C. Debited to purchase account  
- D. Capital expenditure  
- E. Deferred revenue expenditure  

**Correct Answer:** **D. Capital expenditure**

**Explanation**

An addition to plant assets **increases productive capacity** or extends the useful life of the asset. It provides benefit for more than one accounting period, so it is treated as **capital expenditure** and added to the asset cost on the Balance Sheet.

---

### Question 5

**Question**

Which one of the following is an example of **capital income**?

**Options**

- A. Income earned before incorporation  
- B. Income from sale of machinery  
- C. Income from forfeiture of share  
- D. Income from sale of wastage  
- E. Income from revaluation of land  

**Correct Answer:** **B. Income from sale of machinery**

**Explanation**

**Capital income** arises from transactions involving **capital assets or capital structure**, not from normal trading operations.

- **Sale of machinery (B)** is the disposal of a fixed asset, so the gain is capital in nature.  
- Sale of wastage/scrap (D) is usually **other revenue income** arising from normal operations.  
- Revaluation surplus (E) is an **unrealised capital gain**, usually credited to a revaluation reserve, not taken as income.  
- Income before incorporation (A) and income from forfeiture of shares (C) are treated as capital profits, but among the options the clearest example of **capital income** that is actually realised as cash is **sale of machinery**.

---

### Question 6

**Question**

Which is **revenue expenditure**?

**Options**

- A. Expenditure for purchase of machine  
- B. Transportation cost of machine  
- C. Wages for machine's installation  
- D. Insurance cost for machine  
- E. Freight for machine  

**Correct Answer:** **D. Insurance cost for machine**

**Explanation**

Costs **necessary to bring a machine to its working condition and location** (purchase price, freight, carriage inwards, installation wages, VAT, etc.) are **capitalized** as part of the asset cost.

Insurance of the machine is a **recurring operating expense** providing benefit only for the current period, so it is **revenue expenditure**.

---

### Question 7

**Question**

Which of the following items, although related to the purchase of a fixed asset, is **not capitalized**?

**Options**

- A. Purchase price of the machinery  
- B. Freight and insurance cost paid for the machinery  
- C. Salaries and wages paid for installing the machinery  
- D. VAT @ 10% paid on the price of the machinery  
- E. Scrap‑value of the machinery  

**Correct Answer:** **E. Scrap‑value of the machinery**

**Explanation**

The **cost of the asset** includes purchase price plus all costs necessary to bring it to working condition and location (A–D), so all of those are capitalized.

**Scrap value** (residual value) is an **estimate of what will be received at the end of the asset’s life**; it is **not** an initial cost and is therefore **not capitalized**. It is only used when computing depreciation.

---

### Question 8

**Question**

An advertisement expense which will be fruitful for four years—what kind of expense is it?

**Options**

- A. Capital expenditure  
- B. Revenue expenditure  
- C. Current expenditure  
- D. Nominal expenditure  
- E. Deferred revenue expenditure  

**Correct Answer:** **E. Deferred revenue expenditure**

**Explanation**

A heavy advertisement campaign that is expected to benefit the business for several years is:

- not a capital asset, but  
- its benefit extends beyond one accounting period.

It is therefore treated as **deferred revenue expenditure**, and the cost is amortized over the four years of benefit.

---

### Question 9

**Question**

Which one of the following is **revenue expenditure**?

**Options**

- A. Cost of acquiring leasehold property  
- B. Cost of depreciation of leasehold property  
- C. Legal expenses in connection with acquiring leasehold property  
- D. Wages for the installation of a new machine  

**Correct Answer:** **B. Cost of depreciation of leasehold property**

**Explanation**

- The **cost of acquiring** leasehold property and legal expenses to acquire it (A and C), and installation wages for a new machine (D), are all **capital expenditure**.  
- **Depreciation** on the leasehold property (B) is a **recurring allocation of that capital cost**, charged each year to the Profit & Loss Account, so it is **revenue expenditure**.

---

## Part B – Single Entry System (Incomplete Records)

### Question 10

**Question**

Beginning capital Tk. 2,00,000, investment during the year Tk. 3,00,000, owner's drawing Tk. 50,000 and closing capital Tk. 7,00,000. What is the profit during the year in Taka?

**Options**

- A. 2,50,000  
- B. 2,00,000  
- C. 5,00,000  
- D. 1,50,000  
- E. 4,00,000  

**Correct Answer:** **A. 2,50,000**

**Explanation**

Use the capital comparison formula:

\[
\text{Profit} = \text{Closing capital} + \text{Drawings} - \text{Opening capital} - \text{Additional capital}
\]

\[
= 7,00,000 + 50,000 - 2,00,000 - 3,00,000
= 7,50,000 - 5,00,000 = \mathbf{2,50,000}
\]

So the profit for the year is Tk. 2,50,000.

### Question 11

**Question**

A businessman maintains incomplete records. At the beginning of 2005, his capital was Tk. 56,000 and at the end of 2005, the balance of his capital account stood at Tk. 1,20,000. In the same year, the businessman supplied equipment worth Tk. 30,000 to his business and withdrew Tk. 14,000 worth of materials from his business for personal use. What was his profit or loss in Taka for the year 2005?

**Options**

- A. 48,000  
- B. 49,000  
- C. 84,000  
- D. 54,000  
- E. 70,000  

**Correct Answer:** **A. 48,000**

**Explanation**

Additional investment (equipment supplied) = 30,000  
Drawings (materials withdrawn) = 14,000

\[
\text{Profit} = 1,20,000 + 14,000 - 56,000 - 30,000
= 1,34,000 - 86,000 = \mathbf{48,000}
\]

So the business earned a profit of Tk. 48,000.

### Question 12

**Question**

Which of the following can be a correct description of an incomplete record?

**Options**

- A. An admixture of single entry and no entry  
- B. An admixture of single entry, double entry and no entry  
- C. An admixture of double entry and no entry  
- D. An admixture of double entry and wrong entry  
- E. An admixture of wrong entry, double entry, no entry and single entry  

**Correct Answer:** **B. An admixture of single entry, double entry and no entry**

**Explanation**

Under **incomplete records (single entry system)**:

- Some transactions are recorded with **double entry**,  
- Some with **only one side recorded (single entry)**,  
- Some transactions are **not recorded at all**.

So it is essentially a mixture of **single entry, double entry and no entry**.

### Question 13

**Question**

The beginning capital of Sheba Co. was Tk. 3,30,000 and the capital at the end stood at Tk. 4,50,000. During the year total revenue was Tk. 95,000 and total expense was Tk. 60,000. Additional capital investment was Tk. 1,05,000. The amount of drawings by the owner during the period was Tk.:

**Options**

- A. 30,000  
- B. 35,000  
- C. 20,000  
- D. 55,000  
- E. 45,000  

**Correct Answer:** **C. 20,000**

**Explanation**

First compute profit:

\[
\text{Profit} = \text{Revenue} - \text{Expense} = 95,000 - 60,000 = 35,000
\]

Now apply:

\[
\text{Closing capital} = \text{Opening capital} + \text{Additional investment} + \text{Profit} - \text{Drawings}
\]

\[
4,50,000 = 3,30,000 + 1,05,000 + 35,000 - \text{Drawings} = 4,70,000 - \text{Drawings}
\]

\[
\text{Drawings} = 4,70,000 - 4,50,000 = \mathbf{20,000}
\]

---

### Question 14

**Question**

At the beginning of the year the total assets and liabilities of an enterprise were Tk. 3,00,000 and Tk. 1,00,000 respectively. During the year, owner has invested Tk. 50,000 and withdrawn Tk. 1,00,000. At the end of the year, closing capital rises by 20% in comparison with the beginning. The profit or loss for the year was Tk.:

**Options**

- A. Loss of 70,000  
- B. Profit of 40,000  
- C. Profit of 70,000  
- D. Profit of 90,000  
- E. Loss of 90,000  

**Correct Answer:** **D. Profit of 90,000**

**Explanation**

Opening capital:

\[
= 3,00,000 - 1,00,000 = 2,00,000
\]

Closing capital is 20% higher:

\[
= 2,00,000 + 20\% \times 2,00,000 = 2,40,000
\]

Now,

\[
\text{Profit} = 2,40,000 + 1,00,000 - 2,00,000 - 50,000
= 3,40,000 - 2,50,000 = \mathbf{90,000 \ (profit)}
\]

---

### Question 15

**Question**

In 2002 a small business firm had initial capital of Tk. 2,20,000. Closing capital was Tk. 1,40,000. In the middle of the year additional capital of Tk. 30,000 was invested. During the same period the owner withdrew Tk. 15,000 from the business. What was the total loss or gain in the year of 2002?

**Options**

- A. Tk. 50,000 profit  
- B. Tk. 50,000 loss  
- C. Tk. 95,000 profit  
- D. Tk. 95,000 loss  
- E. None of the above  

**Correct Answer:** **D. Tk. 95,000 loss**

**Explanation**

\[
\text{Profit/Loss} = 1,40,000 + 15,000 - 2,20,000 - 30,000
= 1,55,000 - 2,50,000 = -95,000
\]

Negative result → **loss of Tk. 95,000**.

### Question 16

**Question**

A business had the following amounts of assets and liabilities at the beginning and end of a recent year: Assets (Beginning) Tk. 1,50,000, Liabilities (Beginning) Tk. 60,000, Assets (End) Tk. 2,40,000, Liabilities (End) Tk. 92,000. Determine the net income earned or net loss incurred by the business during the year under the following assumptions: The owner made no additional investment in the business during the year but withdrew Tk. 3,500 per month to pay personal living expenses.

**Options**

- A. Tk. 1,50,000 profit  
- B. Tk. 1,00,000 loss  
- C. Tk. 58,000 profit  
- D. Tk. 1,00,000 profit  
- E. Tk. 1,45,500 profit  

**Correct Answer:** **D. Tk. 1,00,000 profit**

**Explanation**

Opening capital:

\[
= 1,50,000 - 60,000 = 90,000
\]

Closing capital:

\[
= 2,40,000 - 92,000 = 1,48,000
\]

Total drawings:

\[
= 3,500 \times 12 = 42,000
\]

\[
\text{Profit} = 1,48,000 + 42,000 - 90,000 - 0
= 1,90,000 - 90,000 = \mathbf{1,00,000}
\]

---

### Question 17

**Question**

If opening capital is Tk. 16,500, additional capital is Tk. 3,700, closing capital is Tk. 11,350 and drawings are Tk. 3,300, then what will be the amount of profit or loss for the year?

**Options**

- A. Loss of Tk. 1,850  
- B. Profit of Tk. 1,850  
- C. Loss of Tk. 5,550  
- D. None of these  

**Correct Answer:** **C. Loss of Tk. 5,550**

**Explanation**

\[
\text{Profit/Loss} = 11,350 + 3,300 - 16,500 - 3,700
= 14,650 - 20,200 = -5,550
\]

So there is a **loss of Tk. 5,550**.

### Question 18

**Question**

A retailer who does not keep books under double entry system had: Fixed Assets (1.1.1998) Tk. 25,000, Current Assets (1.1.1998) Tk. 54,000, Total Liabilities (1.1.1998) Tk. 23,000, Fixed Assets (31.12.1998) Tk. 30,000, Current Assets (31.12.1998) Tk. 77,000, Total Liabilities (31.12.1998) Tk. 32,000. During 1998, he introduced Tk. 6,000 as fresh capital and withdrew Tk. 11,000 for personal use. What is the amount of profit he earned during 1998?

**Options**

- A. Tk. 19,000  
- B. Tk. 24,000  
- C. Tk. 30,000  
- D. Tk. 36,000  

**Correct Answer:** **B. Tk. 24,000**

**Explanation**

Opening capital:

\[
= (25,000 + 54,000) - 23,000 = 56,000
\]

Closing capital:

\[
= (30,000 + 77,000) - 32,000 = 75,000
\]

\[
\text{Profit} = 75,000 + 11,000 - 56,000 - 6,000
= 86,000 - 62,000 = \mathbf{24,000}
\]

---

### Question 19

**Question**

The ending balance of owner's capital was Tk. 21,000. During that year, the owner contributed Tk. 6,000 and withdrew Tk. 4,000. If the firm had Tk. 8,000 net income for the year, what was the beginning owner's capital?

**Options**

- A. Tk. 19,000  
- B. Tk. 11,000  
- C. Tk. 21,000  
- D. Tk. 23,000  

**Correct Answer:** **B. Tk. 11,000**

**Explanation**

Re‑arrange the capital formula to find opening capital:

\[
\text{Opening capital}
= \text{Closing capital} + \text{Drawings} - \text{Additional capital} - \text{Profit}
\]

\[
= 21,000 + 4,000 - 6,000 - 8,000
= 25,000 - 14,000 = \mathbf{11,000}
\]

---

### Question 20

**Question**

A sole trader had on 1 January 1990 assets of Tk. 50,000 and liabilities of Tk. 25,000 and on 31 December 1990 assets of Tk. 65,000 and liabilities of Tk. 17,000. He has earned profit during the year:

**Options**

- A. Tk. 25,000  
- B. Tk. 8,000  
- C. Tk. 23,000  
- D. Tk. 73,000  

**Correct Answer:** **C. Tk. 23,000**

**Explanation**

Opening capital:

\[
= 50,000 - 25,000 = 25,000
\]

Closing capital:

\[
= 65,000 - 17,000 = 48,000
\]

Assuming no drawings or additional capital:

\[
\text{Profit} = 48,000 - 25,000 = \mathbf{23,000}
\]

## Part C – Cash Flow Statement

### Question 21

**Question**

What kind of cash flow is the **sale of old furniture**?

**Options**

- A. Operating  
- B. Investing  
- C. Financing  
- D. A and B  
- E. A, B and C  

**Correct Answer:** **B. Investing**

**Explanation**

Old furniture is a **fixed asset**. Cash received from its sale is a cash inflow from **investing activities**, because investing activities include acquisition and disposal of long‑term assets (property, plant and equipment). It is not an operating or financing cash flow.

---

### Question 22

**Question**

What is the main reason for preparing the statement of cash flow?

**Options**

- A. To agree with the Company Acts  
- B. To show the financial position of the Company  
- C. To show the profit and loss of the Company  
- D. To show the sources and uses of cash  
- E. To know the amount of cash to be shown on a balance sheet  

**Correct Answer:** **D. To show the sources and uses of cash**

**Explanation**

The **primary purpose** of the cash flow statement is to show:

- from **where** cash was generated (sources/inflows), and  
- **how** it was used (outflows),

classified into operating, investing and financing activities. The Balance Sheet already shows financial position and the Income Statement shows profit or loss; the cash flow statement focuses specifically on **cash movements** and liquidity.

## Part D – Introduction to Managerial Accounting

### Question 23

**Question**

Which of the following information is **unnecessary** to determine the breakeven point of a company?

**Options**

- A. Fixed cost  
- B. Variable cost  
- C. Price of the product  
- D. Contribution margin  
- E. Average cost  

**Correct Answer:** **E. Average cost**

**Explanation**

To compute **breakeven point (BEP)** you need:

- **Fixed costs**,  
- **Variable cost per unit** (or contribution margin per unit), and  
- **Selling price per unit**.

Contribution margin per unit = Selling price − Variable cost per unit.

BEP (units) = Fixed costs ÷ Contribution margin per unit.

**Average cost** (total cost ÷ units) changes with volume and is **not** required for BEP calculations, so it is unnecessary here.
