**Explanation:**  
The **use of office supplies** occurs **within the organisation** and does not involve an external party, so it is an **internal transaction**. The other options involve exchanges with outside parties.

**Correct Answer:**  
**C**

**Accepting an order** is only a **promise/commitment**; no goods or cash have yet changed hands. It is therefore **not a completed transaction** for accounting purposes. The other options all involve actual exchanges with monetary effect.

**C**

**Explanation:**

**Explanation:**  
In the **accrual basis**,
