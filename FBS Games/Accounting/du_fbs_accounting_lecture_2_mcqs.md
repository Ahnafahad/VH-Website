## Section 1: Accounting Equation & Transaction Analysis (DU Past Questions)

### Question 1

**Question:**  
During 2011 Square Pharmaceuticals Ltd.'s assets are decreased by Tk. 50,000 and liabilities are also decreased by Tk. 90,000. Its owners' equity, therefore, is:

**Options:**  
A. Increased by Tk. 40,000  
B. Decreased by Tk. 1,40,000  
C. Decreased by Tk. 40,000  
D. Increased by Tk. 1,40,000  
E. Remains unchanged  

**Correct Answer:**  
**A**

**Explanation:**  
Change in Owner's Equity = Change in Assets − Change in Liabilities  
= (−50,000) − (−90,000) = +40,000.  
So owner's equity increased by Tk. 40,000.

### Question 2

**Question:**  
Which of the following is the expanded form of accounting equation?

**Options:**  
A. Assets + Liabilities = Owner's capital + Owner's drawing + Revenue + Expenses  
B. Assets = Liabilities + Owner's capital + Owner's drawing + Revenue − Expenses  
C. Assets = Liabilities − Owner's capital − Owner's drawing − Revenue − Expenses  
D. Assets = Liabilities + Owner's capital − Owner's drawing + Revenue − Expenses  
E. Assets + Liabilities = Owner's capital − Owner's drawing + Revenue − Expenses  

**Correct Answer:**  
**D**

**Explanation:**  
Expanded accounting equation for a sole trader:  
Assets = Liabilities + Capital − Drawings + Revenues − Expenses.  
This matches option D.

### Question 3

**Question:**  
If Tk. 100 is stolen from the cash of a business, what will be its impact on accounts?

**Options:**  
A. Decrease in cash, increase in expenses  
B. Increase in cash, increase in expenses  
C. Decrease in cash, increase in expenses  
D. Increase in cash, decrease in expenses  
E. No impact on accounts  

**Correct Answer:**  
**A**

**Explanation:**  
When cash is stolen, the Cash account decreases and a loss is recognised as an expense (e.g., Theft Loss). So assets (cash) go down and expenses go up, reducing equity.

---

### Question 4

**Question:**  
Which of the following effects will the sale of goods on account have on the basic accounting equation?

**Options:**  
A. Increase in assets and decrease in owner's equity  
B. Increase in assets and increase in owner's equity  
C. Decrease in assets and increase in liabilities  
D. Increase in assets and increase in liabilities  
E. No change in assets, liabilities and owner's equity  

**Correct Answer:**  
**B**

**Explanation:**  
Sale on account (credit sale) increases **Accounts Receivable** (asset) and **Sales Revenue**. Revenue increases owner's equity. So both assets and owner's equity increase.

---

### Question 5

**Question:**  
The relationship among assets, liabilities and capital is expressed through:

**Options:**  
A. Dual aspect  
B. Accounting Equation  
C. Balance Sheet  
D. Profit and Loss Account  
E. Debit and Credit  

**Correct Answer:**  
**B**

**Explanation:**  
The **accounting equation** (Assets = Liabilities + Owner's Equity) directly expresses the relationship among assets, liabilities, and capital.

---

### Question 6

**Question:**  
A transaction caused a decrease of Tk. 10,000 in both total assets and total liabilities. This transaction could have been:

**Options:**  
A. A cash purchase of a printer for Tk. 10,000  
B. Destroy of an asset by fire costing Tk. 10,000  
C. A repayment of Tk. 10,000 bank loan  
D. A collection of Tk. 10,000 account receivable  
E. A purchase of goods on credit  

**Correct Answer:**  
**C**

**Explanation:**  
Repaying a bank loan reduces **Cash** (asset) by Tk. 10,000 and reduces **Loan Payable** (liability) by Tk. 10,000. Both sides decrease equally, keeping the equation balanced.

---

### Question 7

**Question:**  
Identify the correct reason for the decrease in owners' equity:

**Options:**  
A. Drawings and a decrease in cash  
B. Expenses and an increase in liability  
C. Drawings and an increase in expense  
D. Expenses and a decrease in liability  
E. Drawings and a decrease in liability  

**Correct Answer:**  
**C**

**Explanation:**  
Both **drawings** and **expenses** reduce owner's equity. Drawings are withdrawals by the owner, and expenses reduce profit. Option C combines two items that both decrease equity.

---

### Question 8

**Question:**  
When services are provided on credit, the effect would be:

**Options:**  
A. Both cash and owner's capital decrease  
B. Both cash and owner's capital increase  
C. Both accounts receivable and owner's capital increase  
D. Accounts payable increases  
E. Owner's capital decreases  

**Correct Answer:**  
**C**

**Explanation:**  
Providing services on credit increases **Accounts Receivable** (asset) and **Service Revenue**, which increases owner's equity. So assets and equity both increase.

---

### Question 9

**Question:**  
A business transaction always affects the:

**Options:**  
A. Accounting equation  
B. Cash account  
C. Profit & Loss Account  
D. Both sides of trial balance  
E. Capital fund  

**Correct Answer:**  
**A**

**Explanation:**  
Every transaction must keep **Assets = Liabilities + Owner's Equity** in balance. So at least two elements of the accounting equation are affected each time.

---

### Question 10

**Question:**  
On the last day of the period, Spectre Company purchased a machine at Tk. 90,000 on credit. This transaction will affect the:

B. Balance Sheet only  
C. Profit & Loss Account and Owner's Equity Statement  
D. Trading Account  
E. Profit & Loss Appropriation Account  

**Correct Answer:**  
**B**

**Explanation:**  
The purchase increases **Machinery** (asset) and **Accounts Payable** (liability). Both appear in the **Balance Sheet** only; no income or expense is recognised at this point.

---

### Question 11

**Question:**  
Basic accounting equation is generally expressed as:

**Options:**  
A. A − L = E  
B. L + E = A  
C. A − E = L  
D. A = L + E  
E. A = E + L + I  

**Correct Answer:**

**Explanation:**  
The basic accounting equation is:  
**Assets (A) = Liabilities (L) + Equity (E).**

A. Profit does not change capital  
B. Profit reduces capital  
C. Capital comes from profit only  
D. Capital comes from creditors only  
E. Profit increases capital  

**Correct Answer:**  
**E**

**Explanation:**  
Profit increases **owner's equity (capital)** because profits retained in the business add to the owner's claim on assets.

### Question 13

**Options:**  
A. Purchasing an automobile for Tk. 10,000

C. Collecting a Tk. 10,000 account receivable  
D. Paying a Tk. 10,000 liability  
E. None of the above  

**Correct Answer:**  
**B**

**Explanation:**  
Purchasing furniture on account increases **Furniture** (asset) by Tk. 10,000 and increases **Accounts Payable** (liability) by Tk. 10,000. Total assets increase by Tk. 10,000.

---

### Question 14

**Question:**  
At the beginning of the accounting year, the balance sheet showed assets of Tk. 682 and owners' equity of Tk. 418. During the year, assets increased by Tk. 37 and liabilities decreased by Tk. 19. Owners' equity at the end of the year totaled:

**Options:**  
A. Tk. 418  
B. Tk. 436  
C. Tk. 474  
D. Tk. 719  

**Correct Answer:**  
**C**

**Explanation:**  
Change in owner's equity = Change in assets − Change in liabilities  
= +37 − (−19) = +56.  
Ending equity = 418 + 56 = Tk. 474.

### Question 15

**Question:**  
Purchase from Mr. Rahman on credit. How will this transaction affect the accounting equation?

**Options:**  
A. Assets and liabilities both will increase  
B. Assets will increase and proprietorship will decrease  
C. Liabilities will increase and proprietorship will decrease  
D. Liabilities will decrease and proprietorship will increase  

**Correct Answer:**  
**A**

**Explanation:**  
Purchasing goods on credit increases **Inventory** (asset) and **Accounts Payable** (liability). Owner's equity is unchanged at the time of purchase.

---

### Question 16

**Question:**  
The accounting equation is the result of:

**Options:**  
A. Application of double entry system of recording  
B. Preparation of a Balance Sheet  
C. Application of Business Entity principle  
D. Application of accrual basis of recording  

**Correct Answer:**  
**A**

**Explanation:**  
The **double-entry system** requires that every transaction has equal debits and credits. This logic leads directly to the accounting equation: Assets = Liabilities + Equity.

---

### Question 17

**Question:**  
Which of the following statements is true?

**Options:**  
A. If you increase an asset you must increase liability or owner's equity  
B. If you increase an asset you must decrease another asset  
C. If you increase an asset account, you must increase another asset account  
D. None of the above is correct  

**Correct Answer:**  
**D**

**Explanation:**  
An increase in an asset can be matched by:  
- An increase in a liability or equity (e.g., buying on credit), **or**  
- A decrease in another asset (asset swap), etc.  
No single pattern among A, B, or C is always true, so the correct choice is **D**.
