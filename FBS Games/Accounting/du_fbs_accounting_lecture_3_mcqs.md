## Section 1: Accounting Fundamentals – Journal, Cash Book & Petty Cash (DU Past Questions)

### Question 1

**Question:**  
Festival bonus will be recorded as:

**Options:**  
A. Cash Dr., Salary Cr.  
B. Salary Dr., Cash and Accrued Cr.  
C. Salary Dr., Cash Cr.  
D. Cash Dr., Accrued Salary Cr.  
E. Accrued Salary Dr.  

**Correct Answer:**  
**C**

**Explanation:**  
Festival bonus is treated as a **salary expense**. When it is paid, we **debit Salary (or Salaries & Wages)** and **credit Cash/Bank**.  
So the correct entry is: **Salary Dr., Cash Cr.** (option C).  
> Note: Some earlier keys show option A, but that would mean the business is **receiving** cash and **reducing** salary expense, which is incorrect.

### Question 2

**Question:**  
A credit sales of Tk. 750 is made on June 13, terms 2/10, n/30. A return of Tk. 50 is granted on June 16. What is the amount received as payment in full on June 23?

**Options:**  
A. Tk. 700  
B. Tk. 685  
C. Tk. 686  
D. Tk. 650  
E. Tk. 735  

**Correct Answer:**  
**C**

**Explanation:**  
Net amount after return: 750 − 50 = **Tk. 700**.  
Since the customer pays within the **discount period (2/10)**, they get **2%** cash discount:  
Discount = 700 × 2% = **Tk. 14**.  
Amount received = 700 − 14 = **Tk. 686**.

### Question 3

**Question:**  
Of the account receivable from Sharif, 10% or Tk. 1,000 has been excluded. What is its account?

**Options:**  
A. Uncollectible debt  
B. Bad debt  
C. Cash discount  
D. Doubtful debt  
E. Trade discount  

**Correct Answer:**  
**C**

**Explanation:**  
When part of the receivable is **excluded because the customer paid early and received a reduction**, that reduction is a **cash discount**. It is not a bad debt or trade discount.

### Question 4

**Question:**  
If a customer returns goods sold on credit, an entry is normally made in:

**Options:**  
A. Cash Payment Journal  
B. Sales Journal  
C. General Journal  
D. Cash Receipts Journal  
E. Purchase Journal  

**Correct Answer:**  
**C**

**Explanation:**  
A **sales return on credit** does not belong in the sales journal (which records new credit sales), nor in cash journals. In this question’s framework, such returns are recorded in the **General Journal (Journal Proper)**, from where they are posted to the Sales Returns and Debtors’ accounts.

C. Cash Debit, Bank Debit  
D. Cash Debit, Bank Credit  
E. Bank Credit, Cash Credit  

**Correct Answer:**

### Question 6

**Question:**  
Sharif has purchased furniture on credit for Tk. 50,000. The related accounts would be:

**Options:**

C. Furniture A/c and Creditor's A/c  
D. Furniture A/c and Debtor's A/c  
E. Furniture A/c and Vendor's A/c  

**Correct Answer:**  
**E**

**Explanation:**  
This is a **credit purchase of a non-current asset**.  
- **Furniture A/c** (asset) is **debited**.  
- The **supplier’s personal account (Vendor’s A/c)** is **credited**.  
Conceptually, option C (“Creditor’s A/c”) means the same thing, but the exam key uses the more specific term “Vendor’s A/c”.
