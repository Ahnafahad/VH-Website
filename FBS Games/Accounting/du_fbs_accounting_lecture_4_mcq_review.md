## Section 1: Trial Balance, Errors & Suspense Account (DU Past Questions)

### Question 1

**Question:**  
The error committed at the time of transferring a figure from the primary record to the ledger is related to:

**Options:**  
A. Omission  
B. Commission  
C. Posting error  
D. Compensating error  
E. Error of principle  

**Correct Answer:**  
**C**

**Explanation:**  
Transferring figures from the journal (or other primary books) to the ledger is the **posting** process. Any mistake made at this stage (for example, wrong amount or wrong side) is a **posting error**.

---

### Question 2

**Question:**  
An amount to be paid to Enam has been debited to Harun's account. What type of error is this?

**Options:**  
A. Error of omission  
B. Error of principle  
C. Error of posting  
D. Compensating error  
E. Error of commission  

**Correct Answer:**  
**C**

**Explanation:**  
The amount was transferred to the **wrong personal account** when posting from the books of original entry to the ledger. That is a **posting error** (a form of error of commission).

---

### Question 3

**Question:**  
Which of the following is a part of the **summarisation** process in accounting?

**Options:**  
A. Identifying  
B. Analysing  
C. Journalising  
D. Preparing trial balance  
E. Posting  

**Correct Answer:**  
**D**

**Explanation:**  
The accounting process has three stages: **recording**, **classifying**, and **summarising**. Preparing a **trial balance** is part of the summarising stage.

---

### Question 4

**Question:**  
Under the **periodic inventory method**, which of the following accounts appears in the trial balance **as a separate account**?

**Options:**  
A. Opening inventory  
B. Closing inventory  
C. Cost of goods available for sale  
D. Cost of Goods Sold account  
E. Purchases  

**Correct Answer:**  
**A**

**Explanation:**  
Under the **periodic** inventory system, there is a separate **Opening Inventory** (or Opening Stock) account which appears in the trial balance along with **Purchases**, etc.  
The **Cost of Goods Sold** account is not maintained on a continuous basis under the periodic system; it is computed only at year‑end.

---

### Question 5

**Question:**  
A trader of furniture purchased furniture and debited it to **Purchases Account**. What type of error has occurred?

**Options:**  
A. Errors of commission  
B. Errors of principle  
C. Compensating error  
D. Errors of omission  
E. No error has been made  

**Correct Answer:**  
**E**

**Explanation:**  
For a **furniture trader**, furniture is **trading stock (inventory)**, not a fixed asset. Recording the purchase in **Purchases Account** is **correct**, so no error has been made.

---

### Question 6

**Question:**  
Under a **perpetual inventory system** followed by a merchandising business, the trial balance will **not** show any account balance for which of the following?

**Options:**  
A. Opening inventory  
B. Sales return  
C. Sales discount  
D. Cost of goods sold  
E. Sales  

**Correct Answer:**  
**A**

**Explanation:**  
Under the perpetual system, inventory is kept in a single **Inventory** account that is continuously updated. There is **no separate “Opening Inventory” account**, so that item does not appear in the trial balance.

---

### Question 7

**Question:**  
A trial balance will **not balance** if:

**Options:**  
A. Purchase of furniture is recorded as merchandise purchase  
B. Salary payment is not posted to Salary Expense in the ledger  
C. Equipment purchased on account is mistakenly debited to Purchases and credited to Cash  
D. Prepaid insurance was mistakenly debited to Insurance Expense  
E. A collection from a customer is credited to the account of another customer  

**Correct Answer:**  
**B**

**Explanation:**  
If the **cash credit** for salary is posted but the **debit to Salary Expense** is **not posted**, total credits exceed total debits, so the trial balance does **not** agree.  
The other choices keep debits and credits equal (they are classification or posting‑to‑wrong‑account errors), so the trial balance can still balance.

---

### Question 8

**Question:**  
Purchase of furniture is debited to **Purchases Account**. What kind of error is this (for a business where furniture is a fixed asset)?

**Options:**  
A. Errors of commission  
B. Errors of principle  
C. Compensating errors  
D. Errors of omission  
E. Duplicating errors  

**Correct Answer:**  
**B**

**Explanation:**  
Furniture is a **capital expenditure (asset)**, but it has been recorded as a **revenue expenditure** (Purchases). This violates proper capital–revenue classification and is an **error of principle**.

---

### Question 9

**Question:**  
A revenue expenditure has been recorded as **capital expenditure**. What type of error is it?

**Options:**  
A. Error of omission  
B. Error of commission  
C. Error of principle  
D. Error of estimation  
E. Error of valuation  

**Correct Answer:**  
**C**

**Explanation:**  
Misclassifying revenue expenditure (e.g., repairs) as a capital item (asset) breaks the rule that **capital and revenue items must be separated**, so it is an **error of principle**.

---

### Question 10

**Question:**  
Which of the following is **not** a clerical error?

**Options:**  
A. Errors of omission  
B. Errors of principle  
C. Compensating errors  
D. Errors of commission  
E. Posting errors  

**Correct Answer:**  
**B**

**Explanation:**  
Clerical errors arise from mistakes in **recording or posting** (omission, commission, compensating, posting).  
Errors of **principle** involve **wrong application of accounting principles**, not clerical slips.

---

### Question 11

**Question:**  
An account balance of Tk. 80 has been recorded on the **wrong side** of the trial balance. All other things being correct, the difference between the two sides of the trial balance would be Tk.:

**Options:**  
A. 160  
B. 80  
C. 40  
D. 240  
E. 120  

**Correct Answer:**  
**A**

**Explanation:**  
Putting Tk. 80 on the wrong side has a **double effect**:  
- The side where it should have appeared is **short by Tk. 80**.  
- The opposite side is **overstated by Tk. 80**.  
Total difference = 80 + 80 = **Tk. 160**.

---

### Question 12

**Question:**  
The **primary purpose** of a trial balance is to:

**Options:**  
A. Prove that all transactions have been recorded  
B. Prove the mathematical accuracy of debits and credits after posting  
C. Uncover all errors in journal and ledger  
D. Determine the net income for the year  
E. None of the above  

**Correct Answer:**  
**B**

**Explanation:**  
A trial balance is prepared mainly to **test the arithmetic accuracy** of the ledger by checking that total debits **equal** total credits. It can reveal some errors, but not all.

---

### Question 13

**Question:**  
If trial balance totals do not agree, the difference must be entered in which account (temporarily)?

**Options:**  
A. Profit and Loss Account  
B. Suspense Account  
C. Nominal Account  
D. Capital Account  
E. None of the above  

**Correct Answer:**  
**B**

**Explanation:**  
A **Suspense Account** is opened to carry the difference while the errors are being investigated. Once all errors are corrected, the suspense account balance should become **zero** and be closed.

---

### Question 14

**Question:**  
A balance of Tk. 42 has been put on the **wrong side** of the trial balance. If everything else is correct, what would be the trial balance difference?

**Options:**  
A. Tk. 42  
B. Tk. 21  
C. Tk. 84  
D. Tk. 24  

**Correct Answer:**  
**C**

**Explanation:**  
Same logic as Question 11: the correct side is understated by Tk. 42 and the wrong side is overstated by Tk. 42.  
Total difference = 42 + 42 = **Tk. 84**.

---

### Question 15

**Question:**  
Which one is an **error of principle**?

**Options:**  
A. A transaction has been omitted from being recorded  
B. A transaction of Tk. 2,175 was recorded as Tk. 2,157  
C. Capital expenditure has been treated as revenue expenditure  
D. All of the above  
E. None of the above  

**Correct Answer:**  
**C**

**Explanation:**  
Treating a **capital expenditure** (e.g., machinery) as a **revenue expense** breaks the rule of proper capital–revenue classification. This is a classic **error of principle**.

---

### Question 16

**Question:**  
Which of the following errors would result in **disagreement** of the trial balance?

**Options:**  
A. Expenditure on machinery has been shown in Furniture Account  
B. Records in the debtors’ accounts have been mistaken with one another  
C. The debit balance of one account and the credit balance of another unrelated account have not been listed in the trial balance at all  
D. One transaction has been omitted altogether  

**Correct Answer:**  
**C**

**Explanation:**  
If a **debit balance** and an unrelated **credit balance** (often of **different amounts**) are both omitted from the trial balance, the reductions on the two sides are **not equal**, so the totals will **disagree**.  
The other options either involve misclassification or complete omission of both sides of *a single* transaction, both of which leave total debits and credits equal.

---

### Question 17

**Question:**  
What should be done if the balance of the **suspense account** is of a substantial or material amount?

**Options:**  
A. It should be written off in the Balance Sheet  
B. Carry forward the balance to the next period  
C. Find the error before publishing the final accounts  
D. It should be written off in the Profit and Loss Account  

**Correct Answer:**  
**C**

**Explanation:**  
A large suspense account balance indicates **significant errors**. These must be **found and corrected** before the financial statements are issued; it is not acceptable simply to write off or carry forward a material suspense balance.

---

### Question 18

**Question:**  
Which of these errors **could be disclosed by the trial balance**?

**Options:**  
A. A cheque of Tk. 574 from Mr. Karim entered in Karim's Account as Tk. 475  
B. Selling expenses have been debited to Sales Account  
C. Credit sales of Tk. 300 entered in double‑entry accounts as Tk. 30  
D. A purchase of Tk. 250 was omitted entirely from the books  

**Correct Answer:**  
**A**

**Explanation:**  
If Cash is debited Tk. 574 but Karim’s account is credited Tk. 475, there is a **difference of Tk. 99** between the debit and credit. The trial balance will therefore **not agree** and will highlight this error.  
The other errors are either classification errors or equal understatements of both debit and credit, so the trial balance totals can still agree.

---

### Question 19

**Question:**  
When is a **Suspense Account** debited or credited in rectifying an error?

**Options:**  
A. For one‑sided errors  
B. For two‑sided errors  
C. For all types of errors  
D. For compensating errors  

**Correct Answer:**  
**A**

**Explanation:**  
Suspense accounts are used **only for one‑sided errors**, where one side of the double entry is missing and the trial balance does **not** agree. Two‑sided errors keep debits and credits equal and do not need a suspense account.

---

### Question 20

**Question:**  
The errors which **do not** affect the agreement of the trial balance include:

**Options:**  
A. Error in addition  
B. Error of principle and certain clerical errors  
C. Error in posting  
D. None of these  

**Correct Answer:**  
**B**

**Explanation:**  
Errors of principle and many **clerical errors** (such as posting to the wrong account of the same type) still record **equal debits and credits**, so the trial balance totals remain equal.  
Errors in addition or one‑sided posting errors usually **disturb the equality** and cause disagreement.

---

## Section 2: Adjusting Entries & Year‑End Adjustments (DU Past Questions)

### Question 21

**Question:**  
The balance in the **Rent Expense** account is Tk. 5,000. At the end of the year, it is found that Tk. 2,000 of this amount relates to the **next year** and should be treated as prepaid. Which adjusting entry is required?

**Options:**  
A. Rent account debit, Cash account credit  
B. Prepaid Rent account debit, Rent account credit  
C. Cash account debit, Rent account credit  
D. Cash account debit, Prepaid Rent account credit  
E. Rent account debit, Prepaid Rent account credit  

**Correct Answer:**  
**B**

**Explanation:**  
Out of Tk. 5,000 initially charged as expense, Tk. 2,000 belongs to **next year**, so it must be **removed from expense** and carried as a **prepaid asset**:  
- **Prepaid Rent Dr. 2,000**  
- **Rent Expense Cr. 2,000**  
This leaves Rent Expense for the current year = 5,000 − 2,000 = 3,000, and Prepaid Rent (asset) = 2,000.

---

### Question 22

**Question:**  
If the adjusting entry for **unearned revenue** is **not** made, then:

**Options:**  
A. Assets will be overstated  
B. Revenue will be overstated  
C. Expenses will be overstated  
D. Capital will be overstated  
E. Liabilities will be overstated  

**Correct Answer:**  
**E**

**Explanation:**  
When cash received in advance is recorded as **Unearned Revenue (liability)**, an adjustment is needed to transfer the **earned portion** to Revenue. If this adjustment is omitted, the **liability remains too high** (overstated) and revenue is understated.

---

### Question 23

**Question:**  
Supplies account shows a balance of Tk. 10,000. At year‑end, Tk. 6,000 of supplies remain **unused**. What is the adjusting entry?

**Options:**  
A. Supplies Expense Dr. Tk. 6,000; Supplies Cr. Tk. 6,000  
B. Supplies Dr. Tk. 10,000; Supplies Expense Cr. Tk. 6,000  
C. Supplies Dr. Tk. 4,000; Supplies Expense Cr. Tk. 6,000  
D. Supplies Expense Dr. Tk. 4,000; Cash Cr. Tk. 4,000  
E. Supplies Expense Dr. Tk. 4,000; Supplies Cr. Tk. 4,000  

**Correct Answer:**  
**E**

**Explanation:**  
Supplies **used** during the year = 10,000 − 6,000 = **Tk. 4,000**.  
So we transfer this amount to expense:  
**Supplies Expense Dr. 4,000; Supplies Cr. 4,000**.

---

### Question 24

**Question:**  
If accounts are **not adjusted** before preparation of financial statements, the effect on net income will be:

**Options:**  
A. Net income will increase  
B. Net income will decrease  
C. Gross profit will increase  
D. Gross profit will decrease  
E. Net income might increase **or** decrease  

**Correct Answer:**  
**E**

**Explanation:**  
Some missed adjustments (like prepaid expenses or depreciation) cause **expenses to be understated**, so net income is **overstated**. Others (like unrecorded accrued revenues) cause revenues to be understated, so net income is **understated**. Overall, net income may go **either way**.

---

### Question 25

**Question:**  
Revenue that is **earned but not collected in cash** is called:

**Options:**  
A. Unearned revenue  
B. Prepaid revenue  
C. Accrued revenue  
D. Service revenue  
E. Planned revenue  

**Correct Answer:**  
**C**

**Explanation:**  
Income that has been **earned** but not yet received or recorded is **accrued revenue** (e.g., interest receivable, rent receivable). It requires an adjusting entry: Asset (Receivable) Dr; Revenue Cr.

---

### Question 26

**Question:**  
What happens when **adjusting entries** are made at the end of the accounting period?

**Options:**  
A. They always involve at least two balance sheet accounts  
B. They always adjust the Cash account  
C. They always involve at least one income statement account and one balance sheet account  
D. They always adjust at least two income statement accounts  
E. None of the above is correct  

**Correct Answer:**  
**C**

**Explanation:**  
Adjusting entries always link **income statement accounts** (revenues or expenses) with **balance sheet accounts** (assets, liabilities, or equity) to achieve proper matching and correct ending balances.

---

### Question 27

**Question:**  
The adjustment for **depreciation expense** is to:

**Options:**  
A. Increase liabilities and increase expenses  
B. Increase assets and increase revenues  
C. Decrease assets and increase expenses  
D. Increase liabilities and increase expenses  
E. Decrease assets and decrease expenses  

**Correct Answer:**  
**C**

**Explanation:**  
Depreciation is recorded by:  
**Depreciation Expense Dr.; Accumulated Depreciation Cr.**  
This **increases expense** and **increases a contra‑asset**, thereby **reducing net assets**.

---

### Question 28

**Question:**  
Supplies on hand on January 1 are Tk. 350. Supplies purchased during the year are Tk. 675. Supplies remaining at year‑end are Tk. 250. What is **Supplies Expense** for the year?

**Options:**  
A. Tk. 1,025  
B. Tk. 1,275  
C. Tk. 75  
D. Tk. 775  
E. Tk. 6,000  

**Correct Answer:**  
**D**

**Explanation:**  
Supplies Expense = Opening supplies + Purchases − Closing supplies  
= 350 + 675 − 250 = **Tk. 775**.

---

### Question 29

**Question:**  
The adjusting entry for **accrued expenses** affects:

**Options:**  
A. Assets and expenses  
B. Liabilities and revenues  
C. Assets and revenues  
D. Expenses and liabilities  
E. Assets and liabilities  

**Correct Answer:**  
**D**

**Explanation:**  
Accrued expenses are **incurred but unpaid**. The adjustment is:  
**Expense Dr.; Accrued Liability (Payable) Cr.**  
So **expenses and liabilities** both increase.

---

### Question 30

**Question:**  
Which one of the following can be considered as a **prepayment**?

**Options:**  
A. Unearned revenue now earned  
B. Payment of two years’ office rent in the first year  
C. Payment of accrued salary  
D. Accrued salary  
E. Receipt of revenue  

**Correct Answer:**  
**B**

**Explanation:**  
Paying **two years’ rent in advance** creates a **prepaid expense** (asset). The payment will be expensed gradually over the rental period.

---

### Question 31

**Question:**  
The journal entry for **“interest earned but not yet received”** will be:

**Options:**  
A. Cash Dr.; Interest Income Cr.  
B. Interest Income Dr.; Cash Cr.  
C. Interest Receivable Dr.; Interest Income Cr.  
D. Interest Payable Dr.; Interest Income Cr.  
E. Interest Income Dr.; Interest Receivable Cr.  

**Correct Answer:**  
**C**

**Explanation:**  
Accrued interest increases an **asset** and **revenue**:  
**Interest Receivable Dr.; Interest Income Cr.**

---

### Question 32

**Question:**  
The journal entry for **“cash payment for insurance to cover a three‑year period”** will be:

**Options:**  
A. Insurance Expense Dr.; Cash Cr.  
B. Prepaid Insurance Dr.; Cash Cr.  
C. Cash Dr.; Insurance Expense Cr.  
D. Cash Dr.; Prepaid Insurance Cr.  
E. It is not a transaction  

**Correct Answer:**  
**B**

**Explanation:**  
Paying in advance for three years of coverage creates a **prepaid insurance asset**:  
**Prepaid Insurance Dr.; Cash Cr.**

---

### Question 33

**Question:**  
An investment of Tk. 60,000 was made in 2005 for 8 years at an interest rate of 10% per year. On December 31, an adjusting entry for **accrued interest revenue of Tk. 3,500** was made. No cash interest was received during the year. The investment was made on:

**Options:**  
A. August 1  
B. May 1  
C. June 1  
D. July 1  
E. September 1  

**Correct Answer:**  
**C**

**Explanation:**  
Annual interest = 60,000 × 10% = **Tk. 6,000**  
Monthly interest = 6,000 ÷ 12 = **Tk. 500**  
Accrued interest = 3,500 → Months = 3,500 ÷ 500 = **7 months**  
Seven months before December 31 is **June 1**, so the investment was made on June 1.  
(The original key showing July 1 is incorrect.)

---

### Question 34

**Question:**  
At the end of the fiscal year, the adjusting entry for **accrued salaries** was inadvertently omitted. The effect of this error will be:

**Options:**  
A. Understatement of expenses for the year  
B. Overstatement of net income for the year  
C. Understatement of liabilities at the end of the year  
D. Overstatement of tax for the year  
E. All of the above  

**Correct Answer:**  
**E**

**Explanation:**  
Without recording accrued salaries:  
- **Expenses are understated** (A),  
- Therefore **net income is overstated** (B),  
- The unpaid salaries (a liability) are **not recorded** (C), and  
- If tax is based on the overstated income, **tax expense is overstated** (D).  
Thus, **all statements are correct**.

---

### Question 35

**Question:**  
If the **debit** portion of a specific adjusting entry **increases an asset account**, the effect of the **credit** portion of the entry would normally be to:

**Options:**  
A. Decrease an asset account  
B. Increase a liability account  
C. Decrease a liability account  
D. Decrease an expense account  
E. Increase a revenue account  

**Correct Answer:**  
**E**

**Explanation:**  
Among the standard types of adjusting entries, the case where the **debit increases an asset** is typically **accrued revenue** (e.g., interest receivable). The credit in such an entry is to **Revenue**, so revenue increases.

---

### Question 36

**Question:**  
At the end of its 2000 fiscal year, Medona Ltd. omitted an adjustment to record Tk. 20,000 of **accrued service revenues**. As a result of this error there has been:

**Options:**  
A. Overstatement of net income by Tk. 20,000 for the period  
B. Overstatement of revenue by Tk. 20,000 for the period  
C. Understatement of revenue and total assets by Tk. 20,000 respectively  
D. Overstatement of total assets by Tk. 20,000 on that day  
E. No effect in the financial statements  

**Correct Answer:**  
**C**

**Explanation:**  
Without the accrued revenue entry, both **Revenue** (income statement) and the related **Receivable (asset)** are **understated by Tk. 20,000**.

---

### Question 37

**Question:**  
A 3‑year insurance policy was purchased in 1998 for Tk. 3,600 and debited to **Prepaid Insurance**. It was discovered in 1999 that no entry had been made with regard to the insurance in 1998 and therefore 1998 net income had been overstated by Tk. 1,000. The date of purchasing the policy was:

**Options:**  
A. January 1, 1998  
B. February 1, 1998  
C. March 1, 1998  
D. April 1, 1998  
E. May 1, 1998  

**Correct Answer:**  
**C**

**Explanation:**  
Total term = 3 years = 36 months, total cost = 3,600 → **Tk. 100 per month**.  
If 1998 income was overstated by **Tk. 1,000**, then **10 months** of expense were omitted.  
Counting 10 months back from 31 December 1998 → policy started on **1 March 1998**.

---

### Question 38

**Question:**  
From the following entries, which one is **not** a major adjusting entry?

**Options:**  
A. Prepaid expenses  
B. Earned revenue  
C. Accrued expenses  
D. Accrued revenue  

**Correct Answer:**  
**B**

**Explanation:**  
The four major types of adjusting entries are:  
1. **Prepaid (deferred) expenses**  
2. **Unearned (deferred) revenues**  
3. **Accrued expenses**  
4. **Accrued revenues**  
“**Earned revenue**” is just ordinary revenue; it is not a separate category of adjusting entry.

---

### Question 39

**Question:**  
Which of the following is an example of an **adjusting entry**?

**Options:**  
A. Recording the purchase of supplies on account  
B. Recording depreciation expense on a truck  
C. Recording billings to customers for services rendered  
D. Recording the payment of wages to employees  

**Correct Answer:**  
**B**

**Explanation:**  
Depreciation is recorded at **period‑end** to allocate the cost of a non‑current asset over its useful life. It is a classic **adjusting entry**.  
The other options are normal day‑to‑day transactions.

---

### Question 40

**Question:**  
The trial balance shows **Supplies Tk. 1,350** and **Supplies Expense Tk. 0**. If Tk. 800 of supplies is on hand at the end of the period, the adjusting entry is:

**Options:**  
A. Supplies Dr. Tk. 550; Supplies Expense Cr. Tk. 550  
B. Supplies Expense Dr. Tk. 550; Supplies Cr. Tk. 550  
C. Supplies Expense Dr. Tk. 800; Supplies Cr. Tk. 800  
D. None of the above  

**Correct Answer:**  
**B**

**Explanation:**  
Supplies used = 1,350 − 800 = **Tk. 550**.  
We transfer this to expense: **Supplies Expense Dr. 550; Supplies Cr. 550**.

---

### Question 41

**Question:**  
Why are **adjusting entries** necessary?

**Options:**  
A. Because many transactions affect more than one accounting period  
B. To make debits equal credits  
C. To close nominal accounts at year‑end  
D. To correct erroneous balances in accounts  

**Correct Answer:**  
**A**

**Explanation:**  
Many items (rent, insurance, depreciation, accrued wages, etc.) relate to **more than one period**. Adjusting entries allocate these correctly between periods to satisfy the **accrual and matching principles**.

---

### Question 42

**Question:**  
An example of an **adjusting entry** is:

**Options:**  
A. The payment of wages accrued  
B. Interest accruing  
C. Payment of advance rent  
D. All of the above  

**Correct Answer:**  
**B**

**Explanation:**  
**Interest accruing** (without cash being received) is recorded via an adjusting entry: **Interest Receivable Dr.; Interest Income Cr.**  
The payment of accrued wages and advance rent are normal cash transactions, not adjusting entries.

---

### Question 43

**Question:**  
Which of the following statements is most acceptable?

**Options:**  
A. Every adjusting entry affects both the balance sheet and the income statement  
B. Adjusting entries do not affect owner's equity  
C. Adjusting entries affect the balance sheet only  
D. Adjusting entries affect the income statement only  

**Correct Answer:**  
**A**

**Explanation:**  
Each adjusting entry links one **income statement** account (revenue or expense) with one **balance sheet** account (asset, liability, or equity). Thus it affects **both** financial statements.

---

### Question 44

**Question:**
