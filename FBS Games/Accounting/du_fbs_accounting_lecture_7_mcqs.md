## Section 1: Bank Reconciliation Statement (DU Past Questions)

### Question 1 – Deposits in Transit

**Question:**  
In a bank reconciliation, “deposits in transit” are:

**Options:**  
A. Deducted from book balance  
B. Added to the book balance  
C. Added to the bank statement balance  
D. Deducted from the bank statement balance  
E. Added to cash account  

**Correct Answer:** **C**

**Explanation:**  
Deposits in transit are amounts already recorded in the **cash book** but not yet recorded by the **bank**. The bank statement balance is therefore **too low**. In the BRS we **add deposits in transit to the bank statement balance** to arrive at the adjusted balance.

### Question 2 – Cheque Issued but Dishonoured

**Question:**  
Which entry will be passed in the books of the issuer (drawer) for a cheque issued that is later dishonoured by the bank?

**Options:**  
A. Bank a/c Dr., Payable a/c Cr.  
B. Drawer a/c Dr., Bank a/c Cr.  
C. Bank a/c Dr., Debtors a/c Cr.  
D. Bank a/c Dr., Cash a/c Cr.  
E. No entry is required  

**Correct Answer:** **A**

**Explanation:**  
When the cheque was first issued, the issuer recorded:  

> Payable a/c Dr.  
> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bank a/c Cr.  

If the cheque is **dishonoured**, the payment has not actually occurred, so the original entry must be **reversed**:  

> Bank a/c Dr.  
> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Payable a/c Cr.  

So option **A** is correct.  
The original key that suggested **“No entry is required” (Option E)** is **incorrect**, because the liability is still outstanding and the bank balance did not really decrease.

### Question 3 – Item Added to the Cash Book

**Question:**  
The item that should be **added to the cash book balance** (i.e., increases the cash book balance when reconciling) is:

**Options:**  
A. Outstanding cheques issued by the company  
B. Cheques deposited but not yet credited by bank  
C. Bank service charges  
D. Cheques dishonoured by bank  
E. Direct deposits by customers  

**Correct Answer:** **E**

**Explanation:**  
When customers deposit money **directly into the bank**, the bank credits the account but the company may not yet have recorded this in its **cash book**. To update the cash book, we **add** the amount of such **direct deposits by customers**.  
Outstanding cheques, bank service charges and dishonoured cheques all **reduce** the cash book balance, not increase it.  
The original key that chose **bank service charges (Option C)** mis‑interpreted “added” and is **incorrect**.

### Question 4 – Not an Item of Bank Reconciliation

**Question:**  
Which one of the following is **not** an item of a bank reconciliation statement?

**Options:**  
A. Cheque paid to a supplier of Tk. 10,000 but not submitted into bank  
B. Cheque received from a customer of Tk. 12,000 but not deposited into bank  
C. Bank debited the client's account for bank charges of Tk. 1,500  
D. Bank wrongly credited Tk. 52,000 in place of Tk. 25,000  
E. Bank dishonoured a cheque of Tk. 51,000 due to post date  

**Correct Answer:** **B**

**Explanation:**  
Bank reconciliation deals with items that cause a **difference between the cash book and the bank statement**.  
- Option **B** (cheque received but **not yet deposited**) is **not recorded in either book yet**, so there is no difference to reconcile.  
- All other options describe items recorded in **one record but not the other** or recorded with **error**, so they appear in the BRS.

### Question 5 – Finding the Balance as per Bank Statement

**Question:**  
Cash balance as per cash book before reconciliation is Tk. 4,800.  
A debtor directly deposited Tk. 1,480 into the bank.  
A cheque of Tk. 600 issued by the business is yet to be presented to the bank.  
Bank service charges are Tk. 300.  

What is the **balance as per bank statement**?

**Options:**  
A. Tk. 5,380  
B. Tk. 6,580  
C. Tk. 3,620  
D. Tk. 3,020  
E. Tk. 7,180  

**Correct Answer:** **B**

**Explanation:**  

Start from **cash book balance** and work towards the **bank statement balance**:

1. Cash book balance = Tk. 4,800  
2. Add direct deposit by debtor (recorded by bank but not yet by us): + Tk. 1,480 → 6,280  
3. Deduct bank service charges (deducted by bank but not yet by us): − Tk. 300 → 5,980  
4. Cheque of Tk. 600 is **outstanding**: it has reduced our cash book balance but not yet the bank’s balance, so **add** it back to reach the bank statement figure: + Tk. 600 → **Tk. 6,580**

So the balance as per bank statement is **Tk. 6,580 (Option B)**.

### Question 6 – Bank Charge Unknown to Client

**Question:**  
A bank charged Tk. 100 to its client, which is still unknown to the client. How should this be treated in the bank reconciliation?

**Options:**  
A. Add Tk. 100 to the bank balance  
B. Deduct Tk. 100 from the bank balance  
C. Add Tk. 100 to the cash balance  
D. Add Tk. 200 to the cash balance  
E. Deduct Tk. 100 from the cash balance  

**Correct Answer:** **E**

**Explanation:**  
The bank has already **deducted** Tk. 100 from the account, but the client has not yet recorded this in the **cash book**. To reconcile, the client must **deduct Tk. 100 from the cash book balance**, so option **E** is correct.

### Question 7 – Error in Recording a Cheque

**Question:**  
K Company issued a cheque for Tk. 785 to Robin, but the cheque was incorrectly recorded in the cash book for Tk. 658. The bank has correctly recorded the payment as Tk. 785.  
In preparing the bank reconciliation statement, which of the following is correct?

**Options:**  
A. Tk. 785 to be added to the cash book balance  
B. Tk. 658 to be deducted from the cash book balance  
C. Tk. 785 to be deducted from passbook (bank statement) balance  
D. Tk. 127 to be added to the cash book balance  
E. Tk. 127 to be deducted from the cash book balance  

**Correct Answer:** **E**

**Explanation:**  
The actual cheque amount is Tk. 785, but only Tk. 658 was deducted in the **cash book**.  
Short deduction = 785 − 658 = **Tk. 127**.  
To correct this error, we must **deduct an additional Tk. 127 from the cash book balance**. The bank statement is already correct.

### Question 8 – Outstanding Cheques (Definition)

**Question:**  
In a bank reconciliation, outstanding cheques are:

**Options:**  
A. Added to the bank balance  
B. Deducted from the bank balance  
C. Deducted from the cash book balance  
D. Added to the cash book balance  
E. To be deposited in the bank  

**Correct Answer:** **B**

**Explanation:**  
Outstanding cheques are cheques that the company has **issued and recorded in the cash book**, but which have **not yet been presented to the bank**.  
They have already reduced the cash book balance, but **not yet** the bank statement balance.  
So, when reconciling from the **bank statement balance**, we must **deduct outstanding cheques**.
