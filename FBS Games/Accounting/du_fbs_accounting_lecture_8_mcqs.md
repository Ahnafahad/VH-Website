## Section 1 – Cost Accounting MCQs

### Question 1 – Definition of Prime Cost

**Question**

What is *prime cost*?

**Options**

- A. Raw material + Factory overhead  
- B. Factory overhead + Administrative overhead  
- C. Raw materials + Direct labour + Other direct expenses  
- D. Direct labour + Factory overhead  
- E. Factory cost + Sales cost  

**Correct Answer:** **C – Raw materials + Direct labour + Other direct expenses**

**Explanation**

Prime cost is the sum of all **direct** costs of production:  
direct materials (excluding scrap), direct labour (direct wages), and other direct expenses that
can be traced specifically to the product.

---

### Question 2 – Cost That Is *Not* a Product Cost

**Question**

Which one is **not** a product cost?

**Options**

- A. Wages  
- B. Advertising expenses  
- C. Factory supervisor's salary  
- D. Depreciation of factory equipment  
- E. Import duty on raw materials  

**Correct Answer:** **B – Advertising expenses**

**Explanation**

**Product costs** are all costs involved in **manufacturing** (and go into inventory): materials, labour,
and factory overhead. **Advertising** is a **selling/period cost**, expensed in the period incurred, not
included in product cost.

---

### Question 3 – Costs Debited to Work‑in‑Process

**Question**

In a manufacturing firm, the costs debited to the **work‑in‑process (WIP) inventory** account represent:

**Options**

- A. Direct material used, Direct labour, and Direct expenses  
- B. Cost of goods manufactured  
- C. Period costs and Product costs  
- D. Costs debited depend on the type of products being produced  
- E. Direct material used, Direct labour, and Manufacturing overhead  

**Correct Answer:** **E – Direct material used, Direct labour, and Manufacturing overhead**

**Explanation**

WIP accumulates all **manufacturing costs** for partly completed goods:
direct materials used, direct labour, and manufacturing overhead.
These form the total cost of production up to that stage.

---

### Question 4 – Not an Element of Cost of Production

**Question**

Which is **not** an element of cost of production?

**Options**

- A. Direct material  
- B. Indirect material  
- C. Depreciation of motor van used for distribution of goods  
- D. Direct wages  
- E. Salary of the machine operator  

**Correct Answer:** **C – Depreciation of motor van used for distribution of goods**

**Explanation**

Cost of **production** includes direct materials, indirect materials, direct wages, and factory/production overheads.  
Depreciation of a **distribution van** is a **selling & distribution expense**, incurred after production, so it
is not part of production cost.

---

### Question 5 – Factory Overhead from Manufacturing Cost

**Question**

Calculate **factory (manufacturing) overhead** from the following information:

- Opening raw materials Tk. 5,00,000  
- Purchases of raw materials Tk. 4,00,000  
- Closing raw materials Tk. 3,00,000  
- Direct labour Tk. 60,000  
- Other direct expenses Tk. 20,000  
- Total manufacturing cost Tk. 12,20,000  

**Options**

- A. Tk. 10,20,000  
- B. Tk. 3,40,000  
- C. Tk. 5,20,000  
- D. Tk. 4,80,000  
- E. Tk. 6,60,000  

**Correct Answer:** **(No option is correct – correct factory overhead is Tk. 5,40,000)**

**Explanation**

1. **Direct materials used**  
   = Opening RM + Purchases − Closing RM  
   = 5,00,000 + 4,00,000 − 3,00,000  
   = **Tk. 6,00,000**

2. **Prime cost**  
   = Direct materials used + Direct labour + Other direct expenses  
   = 6,00,000 + 60,000 + 20,000  
   = **Tk. 6,80,000**

3. **Total manufacturing cost**  
   = Prime cost + Factory overhead  

   So, Factory overhead  
   = 12,20,000 − 6,80,000  
   = **Tk. 5,40,000**

The original solution subtracted direct labour twice and obtained Tk. 4,80,000, which is incorrect.  
Since **Tk. 5,40,000** is not in the options, the question as printed is inconsistent.

### Question 6 – Identifying a Production Cost

**Question**

Which one is a **production cost**?

**Options**

- A. Advertising  
- B. Office light  
- C. Factory rent  
- D. Income tax  
- E. Accountant's salary  

**Correct Answer:** **C – Factory rent**

**Explanation**

Production costs are all costs **inside the factory** involved in manufacturing the product.  
Factory rent is a **manufacturing overhead**. Advertising, office light, accountant's salary, and income tax
are not factory production costs.

---

### Question 7 – Cost of Goods Manufactured (COGM)

**Question**

Determine the **cost of goods manufactured (COGM)** from the following data:

- Direct material Tk. 70,000  
- Direct wages Tk. 20,000  
- Freight cost Tk. 12,000  
- Carriage outward Tk. 5,000  
- Supervisor's salary Tk. 10,000  
- Depreciation on machinery Tk. 17,000  
- Beginning work in process Tk. 25,000  
- Ending work in process Tk. 33,000  
- Closing finished goods Tk. 20,000  

**Options**

- A. Tk. 1,11,000  
- B. Tk. 1,06,000  
- C. Tk. 1,01,000  
- D. Tk. 89,000  
- E. Tk. 91,000  

**Correct Answer:** **(No option is correct – correct COGM is Tk. 1,21,000)**

**Explanation**

1. Treat **freight cost** as a direct (or manufacturing) cost, but **carriage outward** is a selling expense.  
2. **Prime cost** = Direct material + Direct wages + Freight cost  
   = 70,000 + 20,000 + 12,000  
   = **Tk. 1,02,000**  

3. **Manufacturing overhead** = Supervisor's salary + Depreciation on machinery  
   = 10,000 + 17,000 = **Tk. 27,000**  

4. **Total manufacturing cost**  
   = Prime cost + Manufacturing overhead  
   = 1,02,000 + 27,000 = **Tk. 1,29,000**

5. **COGM**  
   = Total manufacturing cost + Beginning WIP − Ending WIP  
   = 1,29,000 + 25,000 − 33,000  
   = **Tk. 1,21,000**

Closing finished goods is **not used** in COGM.  
The explanation in the slide correctly computes **Tk. 1,21,000**, but the MCQ options do not
contain this value.

### Question 8 – Prime Cost Calculation

**Question**

Determine the **prime cost** from the following information:

- Purchase price of raw materials Tk. 66,000  
- Direct wages Tk. 52,500  
- Other direct cost Tk. 3,000  
- Carriage outward Tk. 5,000  
- Supervisor's salary Tk. 7,000  

**Options**

- A. Tk. 1,18,500  
- B. Tk. 1,21,500  
- C. Tk. 66,000  
- D. Tk. 1,33,500  
- E. Tk. 52,500  

**Correct Answer:** **B – Tk. 1,21,500**

**Explanation**

Prime cost = Direct materials + Direct wages + Other direct costs  
= 66,000 + 52,500 + 3,000  
= **Tk. 1,21,500**

Carriage outward and supervisor's salary are not part of prime cost.

### Question 9 – Not a Factory Overhead

**Question**

Which of the following is **not** a factory overhead?

**Options**

- A. Wages  
- B. Electricity expenses  
- C. Salary of the factory manager  
- D. Salary of guards  
- E. Repair expenses of machine  

**Correct Answer:** **A – Wages**

**Explanation**

Factory overhead includes **indirect** factory costs: electricity, factory manager’s salary, security,
machine repairs, etc.  
The term **“wages”** (when not qualified) typically refers to **direct factory wages**, which are a
component of **prime cost**, not overhead.

---

### Question 10 – Cost of Goods Manufactured with Applied Overhead

**Question**

During an accounting period, a manufacturing concern incurred:

- Direct material **used** Tk. 3,75,000  
- Direct wages Tk. 4,00,000  
- Factory overhead **applied** to production @ 80% of wage cost  
- Actual factory overhead costs Tk. 3,75,000  
- Selling and distribution expenses Tk. 2,50,000  
- No beginning or ending inventory of work in process  

What is the **cost of goods manufactured** during the period?

**Options**

- A. Tk. 11,50,000  
- B. Tk. 14,00,000  
- C. Tk. 10,95,000  
- D. Tk. 13,45,000  
- E. Tk. 15,05,000  

**Correct Answer:** **C – Tk. 10,95,000**

**Explanation**

Factory overhead **applied** = 80% of wages  
= 0.8 × 4,00,000 = **Tk. 3,20,000**

COGM = Direct materials used + Direct labour + Applied factory overhead  
= 3,75,000 + 4,00,000 + 3,20,000  
= **Tk. 10,95,000**

Actual overhead and selling/distribution expenses are **not** part of COGM.

### Question 11 – Not a Direct Benefit of Cost Accounting

**Question**

Which of the following is **not** a direct benefit of cost accounting?

**Options**

- A. Identifying unprofitable products  
- B. Closing inventory valuation  
- C. Future planning  
- D. Motivating employees  
- E. Performance evaluation  

**Correct Answer:** **D – Motivating employees**

**Explanation**

Direct benefits of cost accounting include:  
identifying unprofitable products, valuing inventory, planning and budgeting, cost control, and
performance evaluation.  
Motivating employees is only an **indirect** effect, not a primary benefit.

---

### Question 12 – Royalty per Unit Manufactured

**Question**

Royalty paid for each item manufactured is:

**Options**

- A. Direct expense  
- B. Direct labour  
- C. Indirect material  
- D. Indirect labour  
- E. Indirect expense  

**Correct Answer:** **A – Direct expense**

**Explanation**

Royalty per unit can be **directly traced** to each unit produced and varies with production volume, so
it is a **direct expense**, included in prime cost.

---

### Question 13 – Per‑Unit Cost of Production

**Question**

A manufacturer in 2002 incurred the following costs to produce 15,600 units:

- Direct raw materials Tk. 10,500  
- Direct labour Tk. 21,000  
- Manufacturing overhead Tk. 15,300  
- Administrative overhead Tk. 15,600  
- Selling overhead Tk. 31,200  

What is the **per‑unit cost of production**?

**Options**

- A. Tk. 4.00  
- B. Tk. 6.00  
- C. Tk. 3.00  
- D. Tk. 3.02  
- E. None of the above  

**Correct Answer:** **C – Tk. 3.00**

**Explanation**

Cost of **production** includes direct materials, direct labour, and manufacturing overhead only:

Total production cost  
= 10,500 + 21,000 + 15,300  
= **Tk. 46,800**

Per‑unit cost of production  
= 46,800 ÷ 15,600 = **Tk. 3.00**

Administrative and selling overheads are period costs, not included in production cost.

### Question 14 – Components of Prime Cost

**Question**

Prime cost comprises which combination of costs?

**Options**

- A. Direct materials and factory overhead  
- B. Direct labour and factory overhead  
- C. Direct materials, direct labour, and direct expenses  
- D. Direct materials, direct labour, and factory overhead  
- E. None of the above  

**Correct Answer:** **C – Direct materials, direct labour, and direct expenses**

**Explanation**

Prime cost is the sum of all **direct** costs: materials, labour, and direct expenses.
Factory overhead is **indirect** and not part of prime cost.

---

### Question 15 – Selling Price per Unit for Target Profit

**Question**

A businessman produces **50 units** with the following costs:

- Materials Tk. 3,000  
- Labour Tk. 1,000  
- Factory overhead = 20% of material cost  
- Selling expenses = 25% of factory overhead  

What should be the **selling price per unit** to earn a **20% profit on total cost**?

**Options**

- A. Tk. 100  
- B. Tk. 104  
- C. Tk. 114  
- D. Tk. 124  
- E. Tk. 140  

**Correct Answer:** **C – Tk. 114**

**Explanation**

Factory overhead = 3,000 × 20% = **Tk. 600**  
Selling expenses = 600 × 25% = **Tk. 150**

Total cost = 3,000 + 1,000 + 600 + 150 = **Tk. 4,750**

Required profit = 20% of total cost = 0.20 × 4,750 = **Tk. 950**

Total sales revenue needed = 4,750 + 950 = **Tk. 5,700**

Selling price per unit = 5,700 ÷ 50 = **Tk. 114**

---

### Question 16 – Prime Objective of Cost Accounting

**Question**

The **prime objective** of cost accounting is:

**Options**

- A. Cost allocation  
- B. Cost determination  
- C. Cost control  
- D. Selling price fixation  
- E. Cost planning  

**Correct Answer:** **C – Cost control**

**Explanation**

While cost accounting also helps with cost determination, allocation, planning, and pricing,
its **primary objective** is **cost control**: monitoring and regulating costs to keep them within
planned limits and improve profitability.

## Section 2 – Accounting for Inventory

### Question 17 – FIFO Inventory Method

**Question**

Which method is used when materials issued from stores are valued so that **materials purchased first are issued first**?

**Options**

- A. LIFO  
- B. FIFO  
- C. Simple Average  
- D. Weighted Average  
- E. Moving Average  

**Correct Answer:** **B – FIFO (First‑In, First‑Out)**

**Explanation**

Under **FIFO**, the earliest purchases are treated as sold/issued first.
Inventory still on hand therefore represents the **most recent purchases**.

---

## Section 3 – Cost and Its Classification

### Question 18 – Costs That Change with Production

**Question**

Costs that **change with production level** are called:

**Options**

- A. Variable costs  
- B. Fixed costs  
- C. Raw materials costs  
- D. Production costs  
- E. Unit costs  

**Correct Answer:** **A – Variable costs**

**Explanation**

**Variable costs** move **directly and proportionally** with the level of output (e.g., direct materials,
piece‑rate wages, some power costs).  
Fixed costs remain constant in total within the relevant range.

---

## Section 4 – Bill of Exchange

### Question 19 – Bank’s Entry When a Bill Is Discounted

**Question**

When a bill is discounted by Mr. Ali with a bank, the bank will pass which of the following entries?

**Options**

- A. Bills Receivable Dr., Discount Dr.; Mr. Ali Cr.  
- B. Mr. Ali Dr.; Bills Payable Cr., Discount Cr.  
- C. Discounted Bill Dr.; Mr. Ali Cr., Discount Cr.  
- D. Discounted Bill Dr., Discount Dr.; Mr. Ali Cr.  
- E. Mr. Ali Dr., Discount Dr.; Discounted Bill Cr.  

**Correct Answer:** **C – Discounted Bill Dr.; Mr. Ali Cr., Discount Cr.**

**Explanation**

From the **bank’s perspective**, it is **purchasing** the bill from Mr. Ali:

- Debit **Discounted Bill** (asset – the bill the bank now holds)  
- Credit **Mr. Ali** (liability – amount payable to him)  
- Credit **Discount** (income – the bank’s earnings from discounting)

The total debit equals the sum of the credits (face value of the bill).

### Question 20 – Maturity Date of a 120‑Day Note

**Question**

The maturity date of a **120‑day note dated August 14, 1990** is:

**Options**

- A. December 11, 1990  
- B. December 12, 1990  
- C. December 13, 1990  
- D. December 14, 1990  

**Correct Answer:** **B – December 12, 1990**

**Explanation**

Count 120 days from **August 14, 1990**:

- August: 17 days (15th–31st)  
- September: 30 days → cumulative 47  
- October: 31 days → cumulative 78  
- November: 30 days → cumulative 108  
- Remaining days = 120 − 108 = 12 days in December  

So the note matures on **December 12, 1990**.
