## Section 1 – Partnership MCQs

### Question 1 – Net Profit Available for Distribution

**Question**

A and B are two partners of a partnership business. On 1 January 2010, their capital balances were Tk. 30,000 and Tk. 50,000 respectively. In 2010, there were drawings by A and B of Tk. 7,000 and Tk. 11,000 respectively. Interest is allowed on capital at 10% and charged on drawings at Tk. 1,000. The net profit for 2010 was Tk. 1,00,000. What would be the net profit available for distribution?

**Options**

- A. Tk. 1,26,000  
- B. Tk. 1,12,000  
- C. Tk. 1,20,000  
- D. Tk. 1,00,000  
- E. Tk. 1,16,000  

**Correct Answer:** **D – Tk. 1,00,000** (as per official key; data are internally inconsistent)

**Explanation**

In partnership accounts, the **distributable profit** is usually:

> Net profit before appropriation  
> **+** Interest on drawings (income for the firm)  
> **−** Interest on capital and partners’ salaries (appropriations)

The slide’s numerical working is clearly corrupted (it subtracts several figures yet still gets Tk. 1,00,000), so the exact computation cannot be reconstructed from the printed data.  
For exam purposes, you should follow the **official key**, which treats the **net profit available for distribution as unchanged at Tk. 1,00,000**, but be aware that the question as printed is defective.

### Question 2 – Partnership Expense

**Question**

Which of the following would **not** be considered an expense of a partnership business in determining income for the period?

**Options**

- A. Insurance expense  
- B. Income tax expense  
- C. Rent expense  
- D. Electricity expense  
- E. Telephone expense  

**Correct Answer:** **B – Income tax expense**

**Explanation**

A partnership is generally **not a separate taxable entity**. Instead, the **individual partners** pay income tax on their share of profit. Therefore **income tax expense is not charged in the partnership income statement**, whereas insurance, rent, electricity and telephone expenses are normal business expenses.

### Question 3 – Closing Capital Balances after Appropriations

**Question**

The capital account balances on 1 January 2006 of Tawfiq and Nafees, two partners, were Tk. 40,000 and Tk. 50,000 respectively. Total profit for 2006 **before** adjusting interest on capital and salaries was Tk. 1,00,000. During 2006, salaries taken by Tawfiq and Nafees were Tk. 22,000 and Tk. 15,000 respectively. Ten percent interest is allowed on opening capital. The remaining profit is shared equally. After all adjustments, what will be the closing capital balances of Tawfiq and Nafees?

**Options**

- A. Tk. 71,500 and Tk. 81,500  
- B. Tk. 93,000 and Tk. 97,000  
- C. Tk. 90,000 and Tk. 1,00,000  
- D. Tk. 80,000 and Tk. 90,000  
- E. Tk. 75,000 and Tk. 85,000  

**Correct Answer:** **B – Tk. 93,000 and Tk. 97,000**

**Explanation**

- Interest on capital: Tawfiq = 10% × 40,000 = 4,000; Nafees = 10% × 50,000 = 5,000.  
- Profit remaining after interest and salaries:  

  1,00,000 − (4,000 + 5,000) − (22,000 + 15,000)  
  = 1,00,000 − 9,000 − 37,000  
  = **Tk. 54,000**

- Share of remaining profit (equally): 54,000 ÷ 2 = **27,000** each.

Closing capitals:

- Tawfiq = 40,000 + 4,000 + 22,000 + 27,000 = **93,000**  
- Nafees = 50,000 + 5,000 + 15,000 + 27,000 = **97,000**

### Question 4 – Interest on Partners’ Loan when Rate Not Mentioned

**Question**

If not mentioned in the partnership agreement, at what rate is interest chargeable on partners’ **loans** to the partnership business?

**Options**

- A. 7%  
- B. Bank rate  
- C. 9%  
- D. 6%  
- E. 10%  

**Correct Answer:** **D – 6%**

**Explanation**

Under the **Partnership Act 1932**, if the deed is silent on the rate of interest on a partner’s loan, **interest is allowed at 6% per annum** by default.

---

### Question 5 – Finding Total Profit from B’s Closing Capital

**Question**

A and B are partners in a firm sharing profits in the ratio 3:2. Their beginning capital balances on 1 January 2006 were Tk. 60,000 and Tk. 40,000 respectively. The partnership agreement provides for interest on capital at 10% per annum on the beginning balances and a monthly salary of Tk. 1,000 for B. The ending balance of B’s capital account on 31 December 2006 was Tk. 1,16,000. What was the **total profit of the firm** for the year 2006?

**Options**

- A. Tk. 1,50,000  
- B. Tk. 1,72,000  
- C. Tk. 1,60,000  
- D. Tk. 1,62,000  
- E. Tk. 1,28,000  

**Correct Answer:** **B – Tk. 1,72,000**

**Explanation**

Work backwards from B’s closing capital:

- Opening capital (B) = 40,000  
- Interest on capital = 10% × 40,000 = 4,000  
- Salary = 1,000 × 12 = 12,000  

So B’s **share of profit**:

1,16,000 − 40,000 − 4,000 − 12,000 = **60,000**

B’s profit share is **2/5** (since A:B = 3:2). So distributable profit:

60,000 × (5/2) = **1,50,000**

This Tk. 1,50,000 is profit **after** charging interest on capital and salary.  
Total profit **before** these appropriations:

= 1,50,000 + (interest on A and B) + B’s salary  
= 1,50,000 + (6,000 + 4,000) + 12,000  
= **Tk. 1,72,000**

### Question 6 – Distribution of Cash on Liquidation

**Question**

When a partnership is liquidated, cash should be distributed to partners:

**Options**

- A. Equally  
- B. On the basis of income-sharing ratio  
- C. On the basis of capital balances  
- D. On the basis of original investment  
- E. None of the above  

**Correct Answer:** **C – On the basis of capital balances**

**Explanation**

After all outside liabilities are settled, any remaining cash represents partners’ **capital**. It must therefore be distributed **in proportion to the final capital account balances**, not according to profit‑sharing ratios or original investments.

---

### Question 7 – New Ratio When a Partner Admitted (Share = 1/3)

**Question**

Two partners share profit in the ratio of 5:2. A new partner is admitted for a **one‑third share** of profit. What is the new profit‑sharing ratio?

**Options**

- A. 4 : 10 : 7  
- B. 10 : 4 : 7  
- C. 7 : 4 : 10  
- D. 4 : 7 : 10  
- E. 7 : 10 : 4  

**Correct Answer:** **B – 10 : 4 : 7**

**Explanation**

New partner gets 1/3 share, so the old partners together retain 2/3.

- First partner’s new share = (5/7) × (2/3) = 10/21  
- Second partner’s new share = (2/7) × (2/3) = 4/21  
- New partner’s share = 1/3 = 7/21  

So the new ratio is **10 : 4 : 7**.

---

### Question 8 – Distribution of Net Income with Salaries and Ratio

**Question**

Mamun and Maruf are partners. Net income of the partnership is Tk. 57,000. The partnership agreement provides for salaries of Tk. 15,000 to Mamun and Tk. 12,000 to Maruf. The remainder is shared in a 60:40 ratio. How much will Mamun and Maruf respectively receive?

**Options**

- A. Tk. 48,000 and Tk. 9,000  
- B. Tk. 33,000 and Tk. 24,000  
- C. Tk. 22,800 and Tk. 34,200  
- D. Tk. 34,200 and Tk. 22,800  
- E. Tk. 24,000 and Tk. 33,000  

**Correct Answer:** **B – Tk. 33,000 and Tk. 24,000**

**Explanation**

Profit after salaries:

57,000 − 15,000 − 12,000 = **30,000**

Share of remaining profit:

- Mamun: 30,000 × 60% = 18,000  
- Maruf: 30,000 × 40% = 12,000  

Total to each:

- Mamun = 15,000 + 18,000 = **33,000**  
- Maruf = 12,000 + 12,000 = **24,000**

---

### Question 9 – New Ratio When C Takes 2/5 Share

**Question**

A and B are partners. Their existing profit‑sharing ratio is 4:3. Mr C joins the business for a **2/5 share of profit**. What will be the new profit‑sharing ratio?

**Options**

- A. 4 : 3 : 2  
- B. 3 : 4 : 9  
- C. 12 : 10 : 14  
- D. 12 : 9 : 14  
- E. 3 : 2 : 11  

**Correct Answer:** **D – 12 : 9 : 14**

**Explanation**

C takes 2/5 share, so A and B together retain 3/5.

- A’s new share = (4/7) × (3/5) = 12/35  
- B’s new share = (3/7) × (3/5) = 9/35  
- C’s share = 2/5 = 14/35  

Hence the new ratio is **12 : 9 : 14**.

---

### Question 10 – Distribution When Appropriations Exceed Net Income

**Question**

Partners A and B have beginning capital balances of Tk. 40,000 and Tk. 60,000 respectively. Profit‑sharing arrangements:

- Interest at 20% on beginning capital balances  
- Salaries: A Tk. 10,000; B Tk. 5,000  
- Any remaining profit shared 2:3  

How much of the Tk. 30,000 net income will be distributed to A?

**Options**

- A. Tk. 18,000  
- B. Tk. 16,000  
- C. Tk. 15,500  
- D. Tk. 14,000  
- E. Tk. 12,500  

**Correct Answer:** **B – Tk. 16,000**

**Explanation**

Planned appropriations:

- Interest on capital: A = 20% × 40,000 = 8,000; B = 20% × 60,000 = 12,000  
- Salaries: A 10,000; B 5,000  

Total planned = 8,000 + 12,000 + 10,000 + 5,000 = **35,000**, which exceeds net income of 30,000.  
The **shortfall of 5,000** is borne in the final sharing ratio 2:3.

- A’s share of shortfall = 5,000 × (2/5) = 2,000  

So A receives:

8,000 (interest) + 10,000 (salary) − 2,000 (share of shortfall) = **Tk. 16,000**

---

### Question 11 – Profit Share with Minimum Guarantee

**Question**

Matin, Jatin and Rathin share profits and losses in the ratio 4:2:1. Matin guarantees Rathin a **minimum profit** of Tk. 10,000 per annum. The profit for the year is Tk. 56,000. What will be Jatin’s share of profit?

**Options**

- A. Tk. 16,000  
- B. Tk. 15,333.33  
- C. Tk. 13,666.67  
- D. None of these  

**Correct Answer:** **A – Tk. 16,000**

**Explanation**

Normal distribution of Tk. 56,000 in 4:2:1:

- Matin = 56,000 × 4/7 = 32,000  
- Jatin = 56,000 × 2/7 = 16,000  
- Rathin = 56,000 × 1/7 = 8,000  

Rathin is guaranteed 10,000, so there is a **shortfall of 2,000**, borne by Matin (the guarantor).  
Jatin’s share is unaffected and remains **Tk. 16,000**.

### Question 12 – Sacrificing Ratio When New Partner Enters

**Question**

A and B are partners sharing profit/loss in the ratio 7:5. They admit C and agree to share profits in the new ratio 5:3:2. What is the **sacrifice ratio** of A and B?

**Options**

- A. 5 : 7  
- B. 7 : 5  
- C. 3 : 2  
- D. 12 : 7  

**Correct Answer:** **A – 5 : 7**

**Explanation**

Old shares:

- A = 7/12  
- B = 5/12  

New shares (from 5:3:2):

- A = 5/10 = 1/2  
- B = 3/10  

Sacrifice = Old share − New share:

- A’s sacrifice = 7/12 − 1/2 = 7/12 − 6/12 = **1/12 = 5/60**  
- B’s sacrifice = 5/12 − 3/10 = 25/60 − 18/60 = **7/60**  

Sacrifice ratio A:B = 5/60 : 7/60 = **5 : 7**.  
(The original slide had a small typo in B’s fraction but the final ratio is correct.)

### Question 13 – Where Adjustments Are Recorded under Fixed Capital

**Question**

When partners’ capital remains **fixed**, the share of profit or loss, interest on capital and interest on withdrawals are recorded in which account?

**Options**

- A. Withdrawal Account  
- B. Capital Account  
- C. Current Account  
- D. Miscellaneous Account  

**Correct Answer:** **C – Current Account**

**Explanation**

Under the **fixed capital method** each partner has:

- a **Capital Account** (fixed balance, unless capital is introduced or withdrawn permanently), and  
- a **Current Account** where all regular adjustments—drawings, interest, salaries, share of profit or loss—are recorded.

---

### Question 14 – New Ratio When Third Partner Takes 2/5 Share

**Question**

Rahim and Karim share profits and losses in the ratio 4:1. They take Alim into partnership for **2/5 of future profit**. Alim brings Tk. 50,000 as goodwill and Tk. 50,000 as capital. What is the new profit‑sharing ratio for Rahim, Karim and Alim?

**Options**

- A. 12 : 3 : 10  
- B. 2 : 2 : 1  
- C. 2 : 1 : 2  
- D. 10 : 5 : 10  

**Correct Answer:** **A – 12 : 3 : 10**

**Explanation**

Alim’s share = 2/5, so Rahim and Karim together retain 3/5.

- Rahim’s new share = (4/5) × (3/5) = 12/25  
- Karim’s new share = (1/5) × (3/5) = 3/25  
- Alim’s share = 2/5 = 10/25  

New ratio = **12 : 3 : 10**.

---

### Question 15 – Sacrificing Ratio When C Admitted

**Question**

A and B are partners in Cosmos Enterprise sharing profit/loss at 5:3. They take C for a **1/6 share** in the new partnership. C pays Tk. 6,000 as premium for goodwill. The new profit‑sharing ratio is 3:2:1. What is the **sacrificing ratio** of A and B?

**Options**

- A. 5 : 3  
- B. 3 : 2  
- C. 3 : 1  
- D. 4 : 1  

**Correct Answer:** **C – 3 : 1**

**Explanation**

Old ratio A:B = 5:3 ⇒ A = 5/8; B = 3/8.  
New ratio A:B:C = 3:2:1 ⇒ A = 3/6 = 1/2; B = 2/6 = 1/3.

Sacrifice:

- A’s sacrifice = 5/8 − 1/2 = 5/8 − 4/8 = 1/8 = 3/24  
- B’s sacrifice = 3/8 − 1/3 = 9/24 − 8/24 = 1/24  

Sacrificing ratio A:B = 3/24 : 1/24 = **3 : 1**.

---

### Question 16 – Gaining Ratio on Retirement of a Partner

**Question**

A, B and C are equal partners. B retires. His share of goodwill is valued at Tk. 9,000. The remaining partners, A and C, decide to continue the business sharing profits and losses in the ratio 3:2. Goodwill is not to appear in the balance sheet. What is the **gaining ratio** of A and C?

**Options**

- A. 4 : 3  
- B. 4 : 2  
- C. 4 : 1  
- D. 5/15 : 2/15  

**Correct Answer:** **C – 4 : 1**

**Explanation**

Originally, each partner’s share = 1/3.  
New ratio A:C = 3:2 ⇒ A = 3/5; C = 2/5.

Gains:

- A’s gain = 3/5 − 1/3 = (9 − 5)/15 = **4/15**  
- C’s gain = 2/5 − 1/3 = (6 − 5)/15 = **1/15**  

Gaining ratio A:C = 4/15 : 1/15 = **4 : 1**.

## Section 2 – Financial Ratios MCQs

### Question 17 – Least Important for Short-Term Liquidity

**Question**

Which of the following is **less important** as a measure of short-term liquidity?

**Options**

- A. Quick (acid-test) ratio  
- B. Current ratio  
- C. Debt ratio  
- D. Cash flow from operating activities  
- E. Receivables turnover ratio  

**Correct Answer:** **C – Debt ratio**

**Explanation**

The **debt ratio** (Total debt ÷ Total assets) measures **overall leverage and long-term solvency**, not the ability to pay current obligations. The other measures (current ratio, quick ratio, operating cash flow, receivables turnover) relate more directly to **short-term liquidity**.

---

### Question 18 – Payout Ratio

**Question**

Which of the following is the **payout ratio**?

**Options**

- A. Cash dividend ÷ Net income  
- B. Net income ÷ Net sales  
- C. Net sales ÷ Average assets  
- D. Total debt ÷ Total assets  
- E. Net income ÷ Average assets  

**Correct Answer:** **A – Cash dividend ÷ Net income**

**Explanation**

The **payout ratio** shows what portion of earnings is **paid out as dividends** instead of being retained, so it is calculated as **Cash dividend ÷ Net income**.

---

### Question 19 – Stock-Turnover Period (in Months)

**Question**

Operating data for Apex Ltd. for the year ended 31 December 2011:

- Sales Tk. 10,00,000  
- Gross profit rate 30%  
- Selling expenses Tk. 1,25,000  
- Administrative expenses Tk. 50,000  
- Ending inventory on 31/12/2011 Tk. 80,000  
- Ending inventory on 31/12/2010 Tk. 60,000  

What is the **stock‑turnover period** in months for 2011?

**Options**

- A. 1.16  
- B. 0.96  
- C. 0.84  
- D. 1.20  
- E. 1.02  

**Correct Answer:** **D – 1.20 months**

**Explanation**

1. Cost of goods sold (COGS) = Sales − Gross profit  
   = 10,00,000 − (30% of 10,00,000)  
   = 10,00,000 − 3,00,000 = **7,00,000**

2. Average inventory = (60,000 + 80,000) ÷ 2 = **70,000**

3. Inventory turnover = COGS ÷ Average inventory  
   = 7,00,000 ÷ 70,000 = **10 times**

4. Stock‑turnover period = 12 months ÷ 10 = **1.2 months**

---

### Question 20 – Item Excluded from Quick Ratio

**Question**

Which of the following is **not considered** in calculating the **quick ratio**?

**Options**

- A. Cash  
- B. Accounts receivable  
- C. Prepaid expenses  
- D. Inventory  
- E. Accounts payable  

**Correct Answer:** **D – Inventory**

**Explanation**

The **quick (acid-test) ratio** uses:

> Quick assets (cash, bank, marketable securities, accounts receivable)  
> ÷ Current liabilities  

**Inventory** is a relatively less liquid current asset and is excluded from quick assets, so it is **not part of the numerator**. (Prepaid expenses are also excluded from quick assets, but the exam key focuses on inventory as the standard excluded item.)

---

### Question 21 – Action That Increases Gross Profit

**Question**

Which of the following would **increase gross profit**?

**Options**

- A. Reducing the sales price  
- B. Reducing purchase price  
- C. Providing long-term credit  
- D. Increasing the selling price  
- E. Reducing the credit period  

**Correct Answer:** **D – Increasing the selling price**

**Explanation**

Gross profit = **Sales − Cost of goods sold**.  
If the cost structure remains the same, **raising the selling price** increases sales revenue and therefore **increases gross profit**.  

*(Note: Reducing purchase cost would also improve gross profit if selling prices stay unchanged, but the official key selects the option that directly increases sales revenue.)*

---

### Question 22 – Best Measure of Ability to Pay Current Liabilities

**Question**

Which ratio **best measures** a firm’s ability to pay current liabilities?

**Options**

- A. Inventory turnover  
- B. Average collection period (days)  
- C. Acid-test (quick) ratio  
- D. Return on investment  
- E. Profitability ratio  

**Correct Answer:** **C – Acid-test (quick) ratio**

**Explanation**

The **quick ratio** compares the most liquid assets (cash, marketable securities, receivables) with current liabilities. It excludes inventory and thus gives a **strict test of immediate ability** to pay current obligations.

---

### Question 23 – Not a Liquidity Ratio

**Question**

Which of the following is **not** a liquidity ratio?

**Options**

- A. Current ratio  
- B. Acid-test ratio  
- C. Asset turnover  
- D. Inventory turnover  
- E. Receivables turnover  

**Correct Answer:** **C – Asset turnover**

**Explanation**

**Asset turnover** (Sales ÷ Total assets or capital employed) is an **activity/efficiency** ratio, showing how effectively assets generate revenue. The other ratios are commonly used to assess **short-term liquidity**.

---

### Question 24 – Return on Assets

**Question**

A company has net sales of Tk. 5,00,000, current assets of Tk. 3,00,000, average total assets of Tk. 20,00,000 and net profit of Tk. 1,00,000. What is its **return on assets (ROA)**?

**Options**

- A. 25%  
- B. 5%  
- C. 10%  
- D. 15%  
- E. 20%  

**Correct Answer:** **B – 5%**

**Explanation**

ROA = (Net profit ÷ Average total assets) × 100  

= (1,00,000 ÷ 20,00,000) × 100  
= 0.05 × 100 = **5%**

---

### Question 25 – Category of Current Ratio

**Question**

Current ratio belongs to which group of ratios?

**Options**

- A. Profitability  
- B. Activity ratio  
- C. Liquidity ratio  
- D. Solvency ratio  
- E. Market ratio  

**Correct Answer:** **C – Liquidity ratio**

**Explanation**

The **current ratio** compares current assets with current liabilities and indicates whether a firm can meet short‑term obligations. It is therefore a **liquidity ratio**.

---

### Question 26 – Least Important Liquidity Measure

**Question**

Which of the following is usually **least important** as a measure of short‑term liquidity?

**Options**

- A. Debt ratio  
- B. Current ratio  
- C. Quick ratio  
- D. Cash ratio  
- E. Cash flows from operating activities  

**Correct Answer:** **A – Debt ratio**

**Explanation**

Again, the **debt ratio** focuses on overall leverage and long‑term solvency. Current, quick and cash ratios, along with operating cash flow, directly measure the ability to meet **current liabilities**.

---

### Question 27 – Profitability Ratio

**Question**

Which of the following is a **profitability ratio**?

**Options**

- A. Asset turnover  
- B. Current ratio  
- C. Quick ratio  
- D. Return on asset  
- E. Receivables turnover  

**Correct Answer:** **D – Return on asset**

**Explanation**

**Return on assets (ROA)** measures profit relative to the asset base, so it belongs to the **profitability** group, along with ROE, profit margin and gross profit margin.

---

### Question 28 – Profit Margin from Net Income and Sales

**Question**

A company has net income of Tk. 24,000, net sales of Tk. 4,00,000 and average assets of Tk. 6,00,000. What is its **profit margin**?

**Options**

- A. 12%  
- B. 10%  
- C. 6%  
- D. 9%  
- E. 6.5%  

**Correct Answer:** **C – 6%**

**Explanation**

Profit margin = (Net income ÷ Net sales) × 100  

= (24,000 ÷ 4,00,000) × 100  
= 0.06 × 100 = **6%**

---

### Question 29 – Current Ratio from Balance Sheet Data

**Question**

The following data are in a company’s balance sheet:

- Cash Tk. 10,000  
- Stock Tk. 20,000  
- Bills payable Tk. 10,000  
- Goodwill Tk. 15,000  
- Debtors Tk. 10,000  

What is the **current ratio** of the company?

**Options**

- A. 2 : 1  
- B. 3 : 1  
- C. 4 : 1  
- D. 1 : 1  
- E. 3 : 2  

**Correct Answer:** **C – 4 : 1**

**Explanation**

Current assets = Cash 10,000 + Stock 20,000 + Debtors 10,000 = **40,000**  
Current liabilities = Bills payable = **10,000**

Current ratio = 40,000 ÷ 10,000 = **4 : 1**

(Goodwill is an intangible non‑current asset, not a current asset.)

### Question 30 – When Current Ratio Falls but Quick Ratio Rises

**Question**

If a company’s **current ratio declines** and its **quick ratio improves**, which of the following is the most likely explanation?

**Options**

- A. Inventory has declined  
- B. Inventory has increased  
- C. Receivables are being collected more rapidly than in the past  
- D. Receivables are being collected more slowly than in the past  
- E. Prepayments have declined  

**Correct Answer:** **A – Inventory has declined**

**Explanation**

A fall in **inventory** reduces total current assets (so the **current ratio falls**), but since inventory is excluded from **quick assets**, its decline can **raise the quick ratio** relative to current liabilities.

### Question 31 – Not a Quick Asset

**Question**

Which of the following is **not** a quick asset?

**Options**

- A. Cash  
- B. Bank  
- C. Inventory  
- D. Accounts receivable  
- E. Prepaid expenses  

**Correct Answer:** **C – Inventory**

**Explanation**

Quick assets include cash, bank balances, marketable securities and accounts receivable.  
Both **inventory** and **prepaid expenses** are generally excluded as they are not easily convertible to cash in the very short term. The standard exam answer focuses on **inventory** as the typical non‑quick item.

### Question 32 – Ratio Testing Financial Solvency

**Question**

Which of the following is a ratio for testing **financial solvency**?

**Options**

- A. Proprietary ratio  
- B. Fixed asset ratio  
- C. Quick ratio  
- D. Debt‑equity ratio  
- E. Capital gearing ratio  

**Correct Answer:** **D – Debt‑equity ratio**

**Explanation**

The **debt‑equity ratio** compares long‑term debt with shareholders’ equity and indicates the firm’s **long‑term solvency and financial risk**. Quick ratio is a liquidity measure, not a solvency one.

---

### Question 33 – Indicator of Solvency

**Question**

Which one is an indicator of **solvency**?

**Options**

- A. Current ratio  
- B. Rate of return  
- C. Debt‑equity ratio  
- D. Quick ratio  
- E. Asset turnover ratio  

**Correct Answer:** **C – Debt‑equity ratio**

**Explanation**

A high or rising **debt‑equity ratio** can signal greater long‑term financial risk. Thus it is a key indicator of **solvency**, unlike current or quick ratios, which focus on short‑term liquidity.

### Question 34 – Current Liability from Working Capital and Current Ratio

**Question**

Sunrise Company has net working capital of Tk. 94,500 and a current ratio of 5:2. What is the amount of its **current liabilities**?

**Options**

- A. Tk. 63,000  
- B. Tk. 94,500  
- C. Tk. 84,750  
- D. Tk. 37,800  
- E. Tk. 27,000  

**Correct Answer:** **A – Tk. 63,000**

**Explanation**

Let current liabilities = **x**.  
Current ratio 5:2 ⇒ Current assets = (5/2) x  

Net working capital = CA − CL = (5/2)x − x = (3/2)x = 94,500  

So:

(3/2)x = 94,500 ⇒ x = 94,500 × (2/3) = **63,000**

### Question 35 – What Liquidity Ratios Show

**Question**

Liquidity ratios show:

**Options**

- A. Firm’s ability to pay all liabilities  
- B. Availability of financial resources to finance total obligations  
- C. Firm’s ability to pay its current obligations  
- D. Firm’s ability to finance development expenditures  
- E. Firm’s ability to pay its long‑term obligations  

**Correct Answer:** **C – Firm’s ability to pay its current obligations**

**Explanation**

Liquidity ratios (current ratio, quick ratio, cash ratio) measure how well a firm can **settle current liabilities from current assets**. They focus on **short‑term obligations**, not long‑term debt or capital expenditure.

### Question 36 – Ratio Measuring Efficiency

**Question**

Which of the following ratios measures the **efficiency** of a business?

**Options**

- A. Gross profit percentage on sales  
- B. Return on capital employed  
- C. Production per hour  
- D. Dividend per share  
- E. Current ratio  

**Correct Answer:** **A – Gross profit percentage on sales**

**Explanation**

**Gross profit percentage on sales** indicates how efficiently a business controls production and purchasing costs relative to selling prices. A higher margin usually reflects **better operational efficiency** in generating profit from sales.

### Question 37 – Inventory Turnover Ratio

**Question**

The following data are taken from the income statement of Skylark Company:

- Sales Tk. 64,20,000  
- Beginning inventory Tk. 9,80,000  
- Purchases Tk. 45,40,000  
- Ending inventory Tk. 10,20,000  

What is the **inventory turnover ratio**?

**Options**

- A. 4.5  
- B. 6.29  
- C. 4.41  
- D. 6.42  
- E. 4.59  

**Correct Answer:** **A – 4.5 times**

**Explanation**

Cost of goods sold:

= Beginning inventory + Purchases − Ending inventory  
= 9,80,000 + 45,40,000 − 10,20,000  
= **45,00,000**

Average inventory:

= (9,80,000 + 10,20,000) ÷ 2  
= **10,00,000**

Inventory turnover = COGS ÷ Average inventory  
= 45,00,000 ÷ 10,00,000 = **4.5 times**

### Question 38 – Transaction That Does *Not* Improve Quick Ratio

**Question**

The quick‑asset ratio is improved by all of the following **except**:

**Options**

- A. An increase in accounts receivable  
- B. A reduction in accounts payable  
- C. Sale of common stock and purchase of marketable securities  
- D. An increase in inventory  
- E. None of these  

**Correct Answer:** **D – An increase in inventory**

**Explanation**

Quick ratio = Quick assets ÷ Current liabilities.  

- Increasing **receivables** or buying **marketable securities** increases quick assets.  
- Reducing **payables** lowers current liabilities.  

Both changes **improve** the quick ratio.  
Inventory is **not** a quick asset, so increasing it does **not** improve the quick ratio.

### Question 39 – Profit Margin (Repeated Data)

**Question**

A company’s net income is Tk. 24,000; net sales Tk. 4,00,000 and average assets Tk. 6,00,000. Its **profit margin** is:

**Options**

- A. 6%  
- B. 12%  
- C. 40%  
- D. 200%  
- E. 4%  

**Correct Answer:** **A – 6%**

**Explanation**

Profit margin = (Net income ÷ Net sales) × 100  

= (24,000 ÷ 4,00,000) × 100  
= 0.06 × 100 = **6%**

(The same figures also appeared in an earlier question.)
