Classical textbook examples include: - **Preliminary (formation) expenses**, - **Discount on issue of debentures/shares**, - Heavy advertising campaigns, etc. Prepaid rent (A) is a **prepaid expense (current asset)** covering only the next period or so, not a multi‑year heavy outlay. Depreciation (B) is an **allocation of asset cost**, not an expenditure itself. Among the options, the most standard example of deferred revenue expenditure is **preliminary expenses**. *(Note: Discount on debentures (D) is also often treated as a deferred revenue expenditure, but DU‑style MCQs usually expect “Preliminary expenses” here.)*"

          "question": "What kind of cash flow is the sale of old furniture?",
          "options": {
            "A": "Operating",
            "B": "Investing",
            "C": "Financing",

            "E": "A, B and C"
          },
          "correctAnswer": "B",
          "explanation": "Old furniture is a **fixed asset**. Cash received from its sale is a cash inflow from **investing activities**, because investing activities include acquisition and disposal of long‑term assets (property, plant and equipment). It is not an operating or financing cash flow."

          "question": "What is the main reason for preparing the statement of cash flow?",
          "options": {
            "A": "To agree with the Company Acts",
            "B": "To show the financial position of the Company",

            "D": "To show the sources and uses of cash",
            "E": "To know the amount of cash to be shown on a balance sheet"
          },
          "correctAnswer": "D",
          "explanation": "The **primary purpose** of the cash flow statement is to show: - from **where** cash was generated (sources/inflows), and - **how** it was used (outflows), classified into operating, investing and financing activities. The Balance Sheet already shows financial position and the Income Statement shows profit or loss; the cash flow statement focuses specifically on **cash movements** and liquidity."

          "options": {
            "A": "Fixed cost",
            "B": "Variable cost",

            "D": "Contribution margin",
            "E": "Average cost"
          },
          "correctAnswer": "E",
          "explanation": "To compute **breakeven point (BEP)** you need: - **Fixed costs**, - **Variable cost per unit** (or contribution margin per unit), and - **Selling price per unit**. Contribution margin per unit = Selling price − Variable cost per unit. BEP (units) = Fixed costs ÷ Contribution margin per unit. **Average cost** (total cost ÷ units) changes with volume and is **not** required for BEP calculations, so it is unnecessary here."
